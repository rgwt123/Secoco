we can discuss it now, right
the court hearing is over, we can discuss it

but why would anyone wanna stole the bible
what happened to her

yeah
she drives me crazy
i can handle everything except a crying woman
who's the woman asked him to drink
i don't know her. i only know she's a journalist
she followed john in the interview
she wanted to ask him to do a follow-up story
here comes a luxury car
oh my god. the driver looks familiar

yes, he's sam
relax. he's nice
why are you so down? what happened
i'm so bored
i need to spend time with a pile of papers entire day
neil's checked all the informations of duran

of course
how can you doubt duran
he would never lie
maybe you're right
i'm nick, i wanna be your stockbroker
i've already got a stockbroker
really? how's his work
has he made you money last year
the economic crisis was in last year, nobody could make money
what are you celebrating
we've got few games left
we have nothing to celebrate until next week
we just want to have a relax
i think our hard work deserves a little reward
is jones there? i need him to do me a favor
he's not here. what do you need from him
check the fingerprints on this for me
see if we can find the owner of these fingerprints
okay, jones's out. you can find him tomorrow

i want to find a dealer named grace
who runs a upscale wine cellar
i need to find her father through grace
i'm going to hold a private wine tasting party
can you invite your friends
you can contact him directly
my friend is a cautious person
he'll come if you'd tell him more information in person
no one's there. that jerk must have seen us
the monitoring shows that he's fled the scene
he's drove away just two minutes before we blocked the building
so you have no idea where he is
we're monitoring him through a traffic camera
he didn't even have time to grab his noteook
i need to talk to ivy
she hasn't talked to me since last time
sorry, ivy's not been in a good mood recently. she's not in the mood of talking
even after winning the prize
she won a big prize recently
these things happen. so am i sometimes
it's ryan, do you know him
yeah, he owns a small factory which products children's toys
the shopkeepers in the city often ask him for cooperation
has neil ever cooperated with him
well, they tried to work together once
now ryan and neil are friends
any information from the head office
intelligence has got it
what did they get
the surveillance video of the restaurant
good job. it's probably vix who found it
peter, why are you here
i happened to go shopping nearby
i just drop by and invite you to tomorrow's party
by the way, is jenny at home
i'll invite her later
yeah, i'll see you tomorrow
what happened to jim
he was caught cheating by his teacher in a test
i can't believe that he cheated
his grades've always been great
yeah, jim lets his teacher down
i've brought some oil paintings recently, i'll show you
all of them are fake
all? how did you know
the real painting has a special security mark
i ‘ ve heard it from a expert
i haven't seen you so happy for a long time
look at you, you're grinning your head off
because it's a nice day
obviously, it's because that you've received a love letter
fine, but love letters do make people happy
what happened to her recently
someone with bad intentions is looking for her
does she know who it is
no, she doesn't, but they're powerful
and they almost find her
is there anything we can do for her
wow, who painted this picture? it's amazing
justin
justin is terrific
i'll find him if i need pictures in the future
yeah, me too
we need an office in our new law firm
yes, i've been working on this recently
did you find it
i'm looking for it
but it's really hard to find it without a certification
jeffery, what's wrong with you
what do you mean? is there anything wrong with me
i mean, why are you drunk driving
it's dangerous, don't you know
i'm not drunk
you'll be arrested
do we have any plan for today
how about playing cards? the weather today is not very nice
now
wait, danny's not here
he has a case to deal with
how's allie recently
i don't know. she's not in my law firm anymore
what? why did she leave
she opened her own law firm
when is it
about three weeks ago
do you know that hayes died of a heart attack
i know. but william said it's a murder
how does he know that
william's read hayes' inspection reports
which shows there were drug ingredients in his blood
peter, tell andrew it's dinner time
i'm afraid that andrew won't eat
what is wrong with him
he's going to have dinner with his classmates tonight
okay, fine
continue the story you told me last time
no problem, where were we last time
the police issued an arrest warrant
oh, right
here comes the climax of the story
we have a lot of works to do today
can we start it now
come on, first of all, you're responsible for collecting cases
she consolidated the cases into a report
bind them and give them to me before getting off work
peter, how about having a cup of coffee
thanks, i don't need coffee now
come on, you'll need it later
you might have to work overtime today
here is the emergency exit, there is only one entrance to the exhibition hall
and there is a service channel
are you going to rob the museum
how come
if you're not going to rob the museum, why you have to know these things
i just wanna hang out here next week
are you agent jones? what a coincidence
john, stop! did you follow me here
hurry up, or i'll shoot you
i'm here by the sense of my pants
hi, darling, how was your day
no bad, i caught a bad guy
well, how about jack
not good. he had an accident today
ah
hi, i'm roland
are you here to identify the will
yeah, may i see the will
they're on the desk
jones, i have something to ask you
what is it
who's that girl
calm down, buddy. she is an icy beauty
but i still wanna try
the pharmaceuticals company release a new drug recently
anyone in charge of research
jones
do we know any related information of the new drug
we got everything we could. it's a new kind of antibiotic to treat infection
sounds promising
when will the party start
4: 00 pm
you need to get everything done
the cake, the costume and everyting
no problem, anything else
and call all the guests
christie called
she let me ask you and susan
if you are available for dinner on next weekend
no problem. why won't you come
i have something to do
who's that girl
diana
did she work here before
yeah, she used to work in law
and now she was brought here by her boss
jack wants to invite you to dinner
why
because you did him a favor on last auction
he wants to pay you back by a nice meal
peter seems busy recently
yeah, he is courting a girl recently
he is good
but still need to work hard if he wants to go further
good luck to him
what do you think of him
he doesn't live a rich life. he has a resentment against the rich
i think he has moral values, he often give donations
donations rationalize his crime
and he is arrogant
he doesn't know how to stay away troubles while he's about to be caught
why is the shop out of power
yeah, it's not the first time this week
i guess they didn't pay the electricity bill
what happened to him
is he crying
yeah
he makes me nervous
he's an adult
is john satisfied with his job
not really, he's too bored
he needs to spend time with a pile of papers entire day
did tom find the safe box
i can't wait
he got it
it's already open
i haven't seen jimmy so happy for a long time
look at him. he can't even close his mouth
maybe it's because today is a nice day
because someone had written him a love letter
well, love letters do make people happy
i was guilty of stealing the bible
but why do you steal the bible
i can't afford it
can you open this safe box
traditional safe boxes are not my strengths
learn to be more flexible. i'm not very good at picking locks
i can only have a try. i'm not sure it'll work
can jones handcuff him
give him more time
i can't stand him any more
trust me, he's not a bad person
he can still be corrected
i hit the jackpot
really? how much did you win
a million dollars
oh, my god. you're so lucky. congratulations
now there is only one question: what am i going to do with that million dollars
look at my friend
it looks a little familiar
does he look like monsieur dupont or not
oh! yes
i said i feel i have seen him somewhere before
it's about time. let's go
don't you need to pick rustie up
is he ready
he's been waiting for us
okay, let's go pick him up
does your daughter go this school, too
my daughter is a senior now and i worry about her all the time
yeah, i always wondering what they're going to do next
your son makes you worry, doesn't he
he is clever but impulsive
send your son here and he'll behave himself
don't run amuck in a manhattan prep school
i've lost a lot of money recently
where did the money use
it's all in the stock market
it'll definitely stand a loss recently. all the people are the same
but i lost more than most people
let's go inside the stadium and have a look
you seem to be in a good mood
my dad took me to a game when i was eight
that's when i decided i wanted to play for the yankees
yeah, that's what all eight-year-olds think
neil, it's your turn, say something about yourself
when did you come out
i came out 18 months and 17 days ago
i didn't count them on purpose
i've never been in prison before, it seems not like something fun
do you know where collins is
i don't. i'll call my husband
i'm sorry to trouble you, madam
got it. collins has gone to my house
everyone is here already, isn't it
cook has not yet
must we wait for him to get in
yes, we need to act together
who has cook's number, please call him hurry
it's been a busy day and i still haven't hacked into their mainframe
have you tried asking peter for help
he did it for me privately last time
and he almost lost his job
then it seems better to keep peter out of the affair
how did the police free merrick
it's for the long haul
you look like you know something. please tell me
the sheriff had a plan. take it easy
what's your plan? i'll keep it a secret
neil suddenly couldn't open the web page
is he connected to the internet
he connects the hotel's wifi
i can open the web page
let me ask the hotel staff for him
are you a friend of neil's
you could say that
can you get him to drop the charges for you
he said i would send him a message if i needed help
that's great
i just got the results of facial recognition
who is he
anderson, he was a naval scout during the gulf war
now he was employed by some of the most prominent tech companies for private security
why did he hide his security identity
probably because of corporate espionage
get your papers in order, neil
it's due today
no problem
can i help you
no. i'd better do it myself
i know how to set peter free
it's a waste of time. if there was a way, i would have found it
there was a procurator watching, it's no use
if i could trip up the prosecutor
i don't believe you have that kind of influence
i'm curious about some of your equipments
you can't check them without a search warrant
do you have a supervisor to contact
certainly, i can call the supervisor
that couldn't be better
did jones come this morning
he came early, in that little room
in there
yes, that room is warmer
let me drive. you're in a huff
i'm tired of sitting, we'd better walk there
we seem to be arriving early
just enough to catch him off guard
it will make him more alert
you're right, i've stolen a lot of things
but i rarely keep things for myself
then you should have a try
that will soon make you rich
hi, what are you doing sitting there
i'm waiting for hagen to get off work
does he work in the building across the street
yes
what time does he finish work
another half hour
how's neal
he looks hurt
has he learned his lesson
it's hard to say, maybe he has
is it a good lesson
we'll find out then
this task is not easy
how much time do we have
twenty-four hours
we didn't have enough time to check it out to get ready for action
unless you go to a place where you've already gone
cuffy is climbing the tree again
don't worry, he's not a child anymore
what is he doing up there
there are other people here. it's fine
it seems that dietrick's flight was delayed
he was getting off the plane with a man in sixties
sixties. who do you think he is
maybe someone he knew on the plane
maybe a business partner
investigate who he is for me
what happened
doesn't my blood tell the story
it looks hurting
justice is worth any price
i'll get you a band-aid to take care of the wound
amy said she was hungry. is there anything to eat
can't she just eat out by herself
let me go out and buy some
why don't you order her a pizza or something
cheese or pepperoni
whatever
sir, what are we going to do next
investigate this train
why
do you really believe he's going to show up on a halloween train
and disappear into the air
did you hear about mona
i heard. she didn't catch the competition once a year
what a pity. she prepared it for six months
don't you think someone's plotting against mona
you mean lucas
there's definitely something wrong with lucas
come and wear this
it will bring you good luck
no, i can't accept this
what if i lose it
then i'll lose you, too
ha, i'm just kidding
let me tell you something
what happened
the homework that spencer handed in is awful
he comes to class every morning with black eyes
i noticed that, too. he may have been under a lot of pressure recently
come on. can you concentrate on the college entrance examination which in a month
this guy is here, can i focus
is spencer bothering you
he is reciting the words loudly
i'll ask him to go to another room
good morning, ian
good morning, would you like juice
why are you being so nice to me
didn't you buy me coffee last time
what's the password for your personal account
do you need this? i'm not sure
this is the bank's policy. do you need to make a phone call
just a minute. i'll contact jaime
i wish i could talk to you and my friends
why
i hope my friends can see your merits, too
why do you suddenly care what your friends think of me
i hope they like you, too
you let mona go out alone, don't you afraid that slat harass her
mona just goes out for shopping
she will call me if she happens to run into slat
i'd rather you went with her together
don't you want to know the truth? we're going to avenge her
it won't bring her back
no matter what she won't come back
we have to focus on protecting the people who are still alive
where's hanna going
she said she was having dinner with friends tonight
how can she not answer my phone
maybe her phone is out of power
almost. but i did call her several times
spencer, we didn't finish our conversation last night
i'm a little busy with my family. i'm sorry
oh, i'm sorry if i bothered you
i'm just a little upset
i'll come to you again tomorrow
he is not suitable for learning now
but he has to go back to school
even if he did, he would be absent-minded
we have to talk to his several teachers
i already did
i have't seen emily for a long time
she has been preparing for a competition recently
would she come to play at my house before the competition? she needs to relax
it probably should be ok. she has no other arranges, either
dad wants me to be with kate. what do you think
i would say no
why do you say so
tom is very fond of you
what are you talking about
he's been waiting for you to come round
jackie asked me to tell you something
tell me what
she threatened to destroy everything about you
what else
she said she was going to get her father to fire you
that's why i broke up with jackie all the time
how could they do that? who could stop them
stop! they won't listen
do they really think cops are stupid
it'll know who's stupid when they get arrested
we've been through so much together but you said something i shouldn't know
what could i do can make you stay out of my business
tell me what happened the night you got home
i told you i was set up by others
how can i trust you when you say that
wait a second, are you leaving, too
i hope to stay, too, but i have a date with horton
i thought you weren't familiar with him
it wasn't before
but who knows we became friends now
mr. mcveigh is an excellent ballistics expert
but i think he's a little conservative
why do you say that
he is good at analyzing the trajectory of guns but not 3d printed weapons
did you notice anything unusual
that's right. can i demonstrate it
i have to admit i'm worried, but go ahead
electronic monitoring has recorded evidence of your crimes
they have no legal force
why do they have no legal force
the police officer will catch it
horton, tell me where exactly did hanna go that night
well, why don't you just ask her
can't you just tell me
she went to the bar with her classmates that night
where's keller? i haven't seen him lately
he went to montague's on the weekend
did he go to visit his parents
yes
life is really hard
alison, why are you dressed like this
shoo, less noise
what are you doing? are you playing a game
i can tell you but you must keep it a secret
i was actually spying on someone
paige, do you need my help
i'd love to, but i can't
the boss will be angry if he sees me idle
doesn't he get annoyed when you chat with other people
no, we're not chatting. we're talking business
hanna, is your mother here
what can she do for you
please tell your mother to bring you to the police station for a blood test
why are you testing my blood
there's new evidence in that case. the blood's the same type as yours
are you doubting me
do you remember when i helped you into the house
i don't remember
i helped you to your bed and then i went into the kitchen to get you some water
and then
you were gone when i got back to the room
spencer, do you think there are any clues in the room
we shouldn't come in. it's not safe inside
now that we're in, just look for it
what are we looking for
a red coat
how was it coming back from new york
i'm tired of driving home. i should have taken the train
how long has it been since you and mona last saw each other
almost a month
take care of her more. she misses you so much
do you know there's a big news in town recently
i don't know. i haven't been here lately
are you in washington for the interview
i was yesterday. i may go to san francisco tomorrow
how i envy you! your life is so colorful
you look a little uncomfortable. do you need some painkillers
what about hydrocodone
no, i had a bad reaction to that
it's not in your case
i heard that the drug with a bad reaction
well, i'll talk to you when i get the results
what did she say the other night when you met her
she said she left new york and went back to rose town
to see wilden
i don't know, she didn't tell me
i know hanna's worried about her mother
but i'm gonna go check on melissa just like she checked on us
what are we going to check
we must find out what melissa did that day
she won't let us find out
someone tried to kill ellie and bury her in the backyard
then someone dug her up like a turnip
why didn't she just call the police
which policeman could she call
wilden or garrett
we have to let ellie back
what are you going to ask her
i need to know what's going on? why did she treat us like this
ellie has always liked to play games
how? is she kidding us
pera has these emails and she's going to release this report tomorrow
how can i get the first publish
we're gonna have to find some news tonight if we're gonna get ahead of her
mr. polma, your sister leah tried to kill herself a few years ago after a long struggle with drug addiction
i know your family refused to help her in her last days
what are you doing? do you want to take a hit while we're not preparing
no matter how hard we try, there is nothing we can do
any family dealing with addiction knows you've done your best
how long do you want to play like this
rhyme? i'll have no problem playing all day
i can see you're a smart girl with a quick mouth and fighting will
but it's no use that you make me angry
i got a tracking license
i can track their cell phones and gps signals from spencer's car
good. when will we know where they are
we'll know it in an hour
good, keep me informed
emily, my dad wouldn't let me go out for the night
so what are you gonna do
i have a few ideas
can you involve me in the plan
i will help you
are you ok? what do you need
i need to know that none of this is real, shana isn't dead
but all these are true
no, she didn't
spencer, hi
eddie, we had not seen for a long time
thank you for coming out to see me, i hope i didn't interrupt your work
i have a few minutes free
great. how have you been
not too bad
good morning, shana
good morning. is your father at home
you just missed him
has he gone out yet
he just left for work a few minutes ago. what can he do for you
something's really up
sarah, are you okay
i'm ok now
think about what you'd like to eat tonight, i'll call for dinner
anything is ok as long as someone can deliver the food
i'll never leave you alone
hi, alison. i'm lorenzo
haven't we met somewhere before
i was in uniform when we first met
oh, i remember
it's nice to come across an acquaintance here
i'm new here, too
god. identify results turned out to be alan
is that judge allen
no wonder he refused to sign a search warrant because he was a patient there, too
maybe he's the killer
would you like me to go with you
no, i can go by myself
i'm gonna hit the crack button
come on
it doesn't look good
shawn planted a self-destruct program in the source code that will empty the memory whenever someone invades it
maybe i can repeal the instruction
you should have made a backup before you started
jane, do you know who the father is
is that what you want to talk about to me
i think you know it
i didn't know it before and i don't know it now
how can you not know whose child it is
i hear juliet's coming over here
yeah, she's supposed to be coming for the manuscript
have you confirmed the time of her arrival here
maybe she drives here, she wasn't on the passenger list on any of the flights
what can i do for you? sir
can i have dinner here
sure. would you like a cup of coffee first
ok, thank you
her preliminary analysis has come out
didn't she drown
she is, but not sea drowning
is it soda
neither. what she inhaled was rain water
her autopsy report showed that she had drowned in the rain
which means the crime scene we're looking for has to have a whole bucket of rain
we know the bodies were thrown into the sea in the harbor
yeah, maybe she was killed near the harbor
darling, did you work overtime again
yes, you're home, aren't you
i just got home, i went to pick up the baby
why are you so early today
school came out early because of an emergency
he couldn't get away for it
i dared to say that yesterday, but i'm not sure today
did you let him talk
yeah, he couldn't even stop
i'm sorry. i should have give you a cup of tea
what about the cookies on the desk
i ate them all
even the chocolate
i ate the chocolate first
he has a low temperature. he must have been sitting here for a while
that's today's newspaper
he wouldn't be reading the stock pages while cutting his throat
the edge of the wound is strange
the whole thing is strange
did you see the man who stabbed her
no, he's far away from me
was she conscious when you found her
yeah, she was moaning then
when did she stop it
just a few minutes ago
she's dead. she lost too much blood
i ordered some nice dishes for you
that's great
that's purple cabbage. nobody used to eat it in salad
but it's a nice food now, right
can you quit coffee
you have a family history of high cholesterol
no
you should go to the hospital
you're so nosy
i care about you
i think i've triggered the power switch
what if you release it now
it's like a mine, if you've stepped on it, it'll explode if you life your foot
we need a bomb disposal expert
you should go, frost
let's have dinner now
why don't we call jonh
no problem. does he know the address
i've already sent him
john found a new job
when
i'm not sure. but he packed all his stuff
even our trophy
he can't take the computer with him, can he
is lucas your lawyer
no. he's the lawyer at a law firm
he worked on the howell's case before
lucas is really a good lawyer
is fritz okay
the bullet hit his shoulder. he is undergoing surgery
when can i talk to him
only when the doctor agrees
give me your hand, i have mosquito repellant here
i don't need it
aren't these mosquitos buzzing your mind
i'm immune to mosquitos
who's in charge of the on-site report
daniel. he just conducted a on-site survey
any discovery
the victim was a white female, and she's probably a teenager
do you know her name
there's no identification on the victim
what do you do for entertainment usually
i'm a fan of red sox
i don't know much about baseball
how can you not love red sox while live in this city
tell me about it
where's nicole
she went to catch alice alone
have she caught her
not yet
alice is cunning. you should go help her
what're you doing
alice's hiding. i'm trying to figure out where she's possibly hiding
any discoveries
it seems that someone's been helping her
are you writing a book
yeah, i just finished a chapter
did you put me in the book? i can be a costar
you'll be in the acknowledgement
fine. anyway, don't make me an english man
their music director is suddenly ill
for no reason? the show tomorrow is very important
maybe i can be their interim music director
only by one night
i'll try
did you brought the coffee
yeah, i'll give it to my boss
do you know whether he likes tea of coffee
as far as i know, he likes them all
i heard meilin opened a restaurant nearby
yes, it's meilin's
have you ever eaten there
yeah, the dumplings there is great
there's going to be an exhibition tomorrow. are we going to see it
what kind of exhibition
the largest pink diamond exhibition in the world
didn't we see it somewhere before
we saw it once last year in paris
why is leah crying
she was ejected from the bakery
how could that happen
leah stole a cake
that makes sense
mom, i'm going to propose to haley
not now. you're still a child
not now. not then. when can i propose to her
you can get married to her after her graduation
jenny hasn't seen paddy since that incident
what's paddy got to do with it
she felt humiliated by patty's arrival
she can only blame it on herself
that's right
look at the girl in white
the one next to john
yeah, why's she crying
you need to ask john if he broke someone's heart
let's go and see
what do you think of anna
i think she is easy-going
don't you think she's mysterious
is she from fbi
keep an eye on her recently
who's neil's new love
tallinn van der sent
i've never heard of her
she's a buyer from that gallary. she is pretty and nice
you should encourage neil if he has a crush on her
i talked to the spy you sent
my spy? what are you talking about
don't play the fool with me
you think he's mine? i have never hired a spy
sorry, what's your name
i'm mcveigh
oh god, what a unfortunate name
sorry, did i bother you
no, i'll call you
cavry's girlfriend moved out yesterday
what? she just left like this
they have nothing in common
merry meet, marry part
no, she had a fight with cavry
it's my honor to meet you
me, too. jone
welcome to visit my house in the future
in that case, don't blame me for my frequent visiting
you're welcome
i have to go. matthew asked me go back to see him
what happened to you
matthew blames me for not taking good care of his stuff
why? it's his own problem
my job is to take care of these stuff while he's gone
why you broke up with sla
it was my mom
why
my mom used to be mean to sla, and she didn't allow me to date him
why didn't you come with him? you can only get freedom by yourself
these clothes were found in the building. it's the same as the one jones usually wears
looks like he did it
it should be jones. but how did he get out of the building
maybe he found a stuff elevator to the gate
he is really something
hey, will. finally i found you
how did you get here
i got a lift from one of your men
where did you meet him
at the gate of the hotel
i did the radius screening and checked the traffic videos nearby
any discovery
i found this
it's the black car
yeah, we can keep on investigating by the plate number
honey, how about school
not bad. i'm starving. can i have some cookies
don't you like my ham sandwich
i'm not a fan of ham
the gallo is the best restaurant in the city. you'll see
let's go. i can't wait
but i have something for you before leaving
what is it
it's a piece of jade
oh, it's so sweet. thank you
why are you hangig out here
jack didn't answer my call
i thought he went hiking with friends
yeah, i'm a little worried about him
don't worry, he'll call you when he reaches there
honey, did you have a great time in grandmother's
yeah, grandma made a lot of yummy foods for me
what did she give you
she said that i couldn't tell you
to ensure the security interest of the country, all meetings must be arranged by american bar council
my friends from the council said they were busy
but they'll arrange it for you in next spring if it's possible
thanks for your help. you are awesome
ha, it's my honor
may i come in
only if your customer comes
okay, let me check
my customer is a cautious person. it'll be much easier if you can give him the first-hand information
i can give him a brief introduction
is it possible to arrest him
jones said he could, but in his own way
i agree if lason can be brought to justice
but it must be legal
i'll tell him
the relationship between me and aria has been hard
i hope she didn't make our relationship worse
i believe we can handle this calmly
that's the best way
so many works, how can i get them done
i can get jenny to help you
are you willing to get jenny back
if it helps
i've been researching the video send by the arsonist
any discoveries
the video has been modified
what do you mean
if i can get the raw data, i'll be able to find the location of the publisher
reyne gave me a dress
why don't you wear it
it's an ugly dress
why don't you tell reyne
i don't want make him sad
mom, why you're here
what are you doing here
we're just playing cards
really? why don't you play at home
the tequila here is only 5 dollars
lena, we need to break up
why? i like you, and i know you like me, too
listen
no, why couldn't we be together
because i'm not ready
do you know the girl in the picture
it's my mom. what is she eating
a hotdog
no way
yeah, your mom used to love hotdogs
but why doesn't she eat hotdogs anymore
because she's grown up
what's this
the federal law enforcement bureau wants your help. neil escaped
why me
maybe because you're the only one who's ever caught him
you would rather trust your broken tie than neil
the broken tie's never lied to me
why don't you believe that he's on the straight
it's easy. it's not who he is
you're too suspicious
hold on for a while, everything will be fine
but what if brie is found guilty
i don't know. let's talk about it tomorrow
have you ever cared about him
i don't want to argue with you anymore. it's late
what did the kid say
he still wouldn't say who bullied him. he just asked me to teach him how to fight
but he's only 5 years old
i don't want him to fight. but every boy would learn how to swing his fist sooner or later
you know what? if you want him to win the advantage, you should teach him the capoeira
the capo what
it's a martial art dance from brazil
you look great in the fbi's coat
maybe you need to consider a new career
no. i'll stick to my old job
what are we looking for
a tramp, who's probably related to the man who killed paul
you're born suspicious
it's just occupational disease. i just like to be safe
i know. but sometimes you need to take a chance
maybe
is everything ready
only your money left
as far as i know, the security system of fed is unassailable
yeah, it's also the most unassailable security system in the world
but you've taken 60 million dollars out of there
that car looks familiar
yes, we met it when we came in
we need to find out who they are
maybe a rival buyer of the chip
let's get closer and hear what they're saying
where's bart
he must have gone to buy the lottery again
what would he do if he hit it
the first thing he would do is to buy a roadster
is it the valentine's gift you received
it's from neil
you look wonderful in this dress
if only i could wear it on the runway tomorrow
maybe someday
i need you to do something
what
i need you to get chole's attention
how's it possible? she treats me like i'm not exist
you need to take the initiative
mr. senator, i'm the special agent peter
hi, peter
thanks for your time
how could i say no to the requests of the law-enforcing agence
i have something to ask mr. senator
will, listen
i know you've done your best
there's no need to say this
let's have a dinner in a week
let's talk about it again later
now, go to your bedroom
are you ready
do you want to vote first
yes, that's a good idea
and everyone here takes a note
you have to examine your own conscience when you vote
the young girl
would she make a heartless killing ？
are you the leader here
yes. what's the problem
the problem is that mr. anders is embassy of the kingdom of the netherlands diplomatic courier's son
so the diplomatic immunity existed
i wasn't here at that time
do you need any help
no
if you have any it problems, please contact me instantly
but not repair it without any minds yourself
you've made an awful mess like this
do you want to stroll around the lake for coming across your ex-wives
no, i'm looking for you
your colleagues said you'd be here
how did the presidential election go
why are you asking? what have you heard
you overthought it
so you and mr. gordon were husband and wife
four years are good, eight years are ok, two years are bad
i hope it doesn't make me unelectable
i'm just here to ask some questions and not to evaluate
so why did you break up ？
that was written in the divorce agreement
no, it just says "irreconcilable."
yes. that's right
i was thinking, ms. gobanza
who the hell are you working for
of course... the governor
then why are you hiding the truth
you're actually here to probe
peter's speech on internet business taxation
i
i got a message
someone called my office anonymously
who claiming that peter took advantage of the governor's words to help you
can you tell me what happened on the night of the murder
we were having a baccarat at that time
sorry, i don't understand
⁣ what is a baccarat
⁣ it is hold by the whole neighborhood down the street
each family prepare a definite dish
⁣ that sounds interesting
you can't have fun without cooking
they skipped my house that night
please, i want to be alone
you gotta tell me what happened
i told you before
i was desperate that time and now i started drinking again
all my friends have deserted me
but i didn't kill anyone
you have to believe me
i believe you
i just hope the jury believes it, too
david, come to check monthly, no arguments
got it, doctor
but you really don't have to worry about me. i am very good
i'll have an interview with you in a month
please tell me
what am i supposed to say
you will let me out
david, you've been here for six months
there's not the slightest improvement in your mental state
i adjusted and i think i'm normal
you weren't convicted because you volunteered to go to the hospital
if i don't see you getting any better
i'm not going to allow you to leave the hospital
i have a stomachache
then you eat the best
well, i'd better not
at present, helen has found out
those numbers are the serial numbers of the best sample
she was on her way to pick up the memo
i was shocked that she was that kind of person
who wants results at all costs
this bothers me a lot
sullivan knew she was researching the company
and she must find out what he has hidden
what do you know about keller
he is a good chess player
he would make ten or even twelve moves in advance
so everything they did:
they sent the helicopter, agents went from house to house
he would predict
they did not know his purpose
yes
how close does it have to be for this thing to work
a distress call from a submarine
is designed to be passive
which means we have to stand on the submarine
that it can detect it
i hate to bring you and that thing
bumming around the east coast
if alex knows as much as we think ，
can she help us narrow down the search scope
it's worth a try
have you ever heard of a double-edged sword
that's the weapon you're holding right now
what else do you know about this weapon, john
what's special about this weapon
it was eight years ago that holt and i stole it for you
in new york
you're holding it in a wrong way
give it to me
the upper part of the handle of the early double-edged knife should be 5 cm wide
grip it like this
a better grip means a quicker swing
a better control
you're right
do you recognize this
it's the work of william blake, if i remembered correctly
judgment day is very appropriate
more like a rush to judgment day
this painting is a forgery
you have no proof that i faked this
not necessarily
why should i be so rash
because you're out of jail, i think
remember to resell it
earn a quick buck
are you saying i'm going to run
william, i know when you occurred something hard to understand
you would like to make up stories
but you can't spit it out
my feelings with jack are real
your love are as real as his limp
you forced me to expose you in public
do you see the bending marks on the edges
i think he took it out of his wallet
why does he have a picture of me in his wallet
i think there's an explanation
the man holding you
the ring
jamie is wearing the same ring today
he knew you before you were five
that's impossible
dear, is this the new car you bought
i know it doesn't seem practical
but andre told me a lot about dying people
i'm not unhappy
i'm not angry, this car is beautiful
just surprised you didn't buy a big car that's all
do you know what ld50 is
mr. sweeney
it's called the half lethal dose
designed by crexen-brandt company
which used to test the toxicity of a drug
if you poison less than half of the lab animals
it's a sign of success
why do you suddenly care about animal experiments
can't i have compassion in my heart
peter wants me to cheat a widow
there are two kinds of widows in the world
the grief-stricken and the relief
what kind did he let you play
the kind that gets targeted for $50 million
is she sophie covington
is she a murderer
no, she isn't
do you want to say after sitting
i don't want to say it here. i hope you don't mind
now that you're here, just tell me
i know this is old history
but i need to clarify one thing
i was really angry when i found that you were with my dad
i broke into his office
you don't have to recount the details of your glorious deeds
i talked to your father this morning
i vividly remember the threat he left on my voicemail
okay
i'm very sorry
can you give me a glass of water? thank you ！
ok
maybe you should go out for a walk
these pills will knock me out for a while
you don't have to be here watching me drool while i sleep
clear your mind, and the spare keys are there
i'll wash the dishes first
and maybe the clothes next
really, i don't mind staying
did they introduce residential ownership rate into the algorithm
no, they considered doing so
so what, they didn't do it
come on
they talked about that in the design of security filters
which introduced the residential ownership rate
that is to say that it automatically puts poorer neighbourhoods at a disadvantage
this is racism in disguise
yes, but again they didn't introduce it
so it's not discrimination
let's leave it to the judge to decide
hey, everyone
we are going to see the biggest banyan tree in the world
does anyone want to join us
who will eat all the mind to leave this fairyland
to take a sweltering ride just in order to see a tree
one of the things i admire most about cameron
is that he was as adventurous as i was
we all like to do as the romans do
learn more about the local people
it'll be all right
we have to trust jane can take care of herself
yes
i remember when she was about five
i looked out of the kitchen window
she is climbing a small tree
the small tree swayed even a bird in it
what about later
she fell from a height of three meters
by the time i got to the back yard
she was already chasing frankie and tommy around the house
i'm sorry the security is so tedious
because we can't let visitors take any sensitive information with them
i see
you can go to the front desk when you leave
get your phone and laptop back
this way, please
thank you
i'm sorry we can't give you a gate card
only regular employees can have
the president's office is just around the corner
i think in your unruly youth
you should have stayed in countless hotels
i seldom stay in one place
what's different about this hotel
it's an architecture at the height of the renaissance
there's also a jacuzzi and a hot stone massage
if there is a next life i will settle there
perfect. then why did you leave
i got word that europol was on their ways
they think i did it in corsica
you can go back to school if you would like to
the problem is i don't want to come back
is there anything you expect from a class reunion? i don't
and i got a job
look
they hire full-time workers
i can learn from the best person
sweeney built half the houses in this town
what do your parents think about it
i do this just because of my family
the sooner i make money the sooner i can get out of there
emily, have you finished packing your closet
still in finishing
i'm thinking about what i don't take
baby we're not moving to the moon
just put them in the storage room
do you want to answer the phone
it's paige. i'll call her later
how long did he stay in jail
three weeks
what crime
possession of drugs
possession of grade b cocaine is a misdemeanor
he was jailed here until he was released on $5,000 bail
looks like he's paying for it with his life
there's about three liters of blood here
it's a miracle he made it to the infirmary
because he is young and strong
okay, is here no cameras
no cameras in the release area
well, you might reconsider it
the first time we ate out
you ask me what i'm up to
and when the first time we kissed
i realized i had nothing
except you
now i want to ask you if you would like to venture with me again
sarah ellis, will you marry me
yes, i will
sorry, i have no purpose to interrupt you
it doesn't matter
i didn't expect to see you under such circumstances
have you been here before
no. never
that looks good, what's that
boysenberries
maybe they are blackberries
i don't know, either
the waiter recommended it to me
what's the matter
i just found that my cousin, 23 years ago
was born in a sanatorium
the adoption process was completed here
i don't know the sex but i know the name of the birth mother
can i get a copy of the adoption records
no, you're neither an adoptee
nor his parents
i know, but we don't know who the father is
the mother is also missing
i hope i can help you, too
actually you can give a hand
who is that
david sutton who is 35 years old
he teaches science and driving in a high school
what a cruel irony
the driving teacher died in a hit-and-run
when school just started
the groundskeeper found him in the bushes
what do you think? an accident or a murder
i'm not sure. frost, follow me
i think he was hit here
take a photo
do you know these two men
should i know them
they were
regulars at the neighborhood shelter
if so, they probably go to sea urchins a lot
is it a bar
yes. it's where all the tramps go
the bartender cashes their social security checks
sometimes they even let you take a shower there
ok. thank you
i haven't thought about mary drake for many years
she is lovely
what else can you tell us
she lacks common sense and discriminability
that's for sure
how do you say that
i used to be an accoucheur
i've dealt with mary's two children
did matt's autopsy report come out yet
yes. i'm still waiting for the poison test and the microscopic report
but i'm sure that
he did not die of natural causes
really
that's an amazing discovery
why don't you two go to sleep
there is a murder trial tomorrow morning
we worry about that and can not fall asleep
don't worry, bree is innocent
the jury will understand that
they are mistaken
let's just say we're worried about bree
but it doesn't help
i've been wondering if we should stand out and help her
confess the truth to the judge
i have the same thought as you
wait, miss. you have to sign it
i'm just leaving
you sit there and drink a cup of coffee
so you're a visitor
what do you think this sign says
all visitors must sign in
peter, i haven't asked him about the welsh gold
why not ask
only the charge of arms trafficking
is enough to judge him for a while
decker signed a deal
he'll try to get away with buying and selling guns
gold coins can be used as our jetton
all right
do you want me to come in with you
no
you made a public statement two years ago
you're an atheist
are you still insisting that
do i think i am an atheist
you insisted on saying yes at that time
that does sound like me
my life has changed a lot in the past few years
you mean the affair of your husband
yes and everything else
if you had asked me six years ago: what will i do today
i'm not going to tell you that i'm running for state attorney
yes, life makes one humble
i cringe at the thought of taking a flight
what are you talking about? you've flown a lot
yes, it's only started from recent few years
i think the reason why i feel nervous is that
maybe there are so many things i can't put down now
what's wrong with you
catch your breath and do not think about your vacation
the vacation hasn't started yet
i mean, i don't think i'll be peaceful by then
a pig roast, then a mountain climb and a show later
aren't you happy that we're all coming here with you
it's just a little different from my original intention
you can't leave without saying a word
you can't do that again
especially after what happened last night
i'm afraid he'll catch you
or hurt you or even worse
the picture in my mind was horribly real
i'm in town, spencer
i'm right here
but i didn't know you were here
your honor, they've found your party guilty four times before
which makes that i was unable to reach an effective defense
you know they're just playing tricks
objection
that is a perfectly reasonable request, your honor
she asked to check the sku of the sweater
what is the sku
inventory components, your honor
every item will have an electronic logo on it
to prevent theft
i'm surprised that you came back
why didn't you call me in advance
i've been to your place
didn't alicia tell you
no
we have a case for you
are you sure
i think alicia's worried about the money
what's the price
increase the price by $20
she said she wanted to confirm with you
three years ago, he was their school's
editor-in-chief of the school newspaper
among the staffs, there was a freshman named penny williams
she committed suicide
she had won the "front-runner" award
which equivalent of the nobel prize for journalism
being a journalist is her dream
i think he ruined her dream
don't you think that he killed her
yes, but i think her breakdown had something to do with him
because his position is threatened
the rest of the staffs had 10 or 15 papers published but penny had only two
it's too few for a nationally recognized talent
yes, there is something's wrong
today is an important day
i have saw it
you're wearing your lucky tie
hey, did you find the bible
yes, at the professor's
neil will go to buy it
then you have to give him money
no wonder you wear your lucky tie
no way. we're going to make a fake transfer
let's play cards
i don't really want to play, mom
are you afraid to lose
you haven't beaten me since i was in primary school
i'm gonna take advantage of your weakness
to win a few times
all right
i talked to the fierce kossack
you've been leaking to the press about what's going on
of the murder investigation information
this is likely to affect the investigation
i didn't let any information out
you used your work computer to send emails
oh, yes, i did
i told my cousin something
he has a crime blog, it was posted by him
this is called leakage
no, i just talked to my relatives about work
is that what you're going to defend
yeah, is that enough
no, it isn't
you're out of luck
why did that fool break up with you
he said it was because i was too clingy
but seriously speaking
i think he wants to look for an older girl
he is at university
what about you
we really didn't fit, so
i might look like a mess now
is my mascara running down
a little bit
can you help me erase it
you used to work here, didn't you? miss frith
yes, as an intern two years ago
do you want to come back to work
no
just a joke
for warming up
well... what can we do for you
it's very late. are you waiting for someone
yes, hughes. i have business to talk about
what business calls for a personal visit from the boss
an undercover police for decades. there is an organized crime and two murders
it's not just involves caffrey and his father
this is public corruption
we need to arrest plath
he has a lot of power
i know that
do you have any plans
i want to eavesdrop on him while he's in new york
this must be hushed up
i am is nick howden and i'd like to be your stockbroker
i had an agent
really? how did he do
did he make any money for you last year
who made money last year
no no
if you hire me, you'll net three percent
after the crash
i don't believe
then give me your email address
i'll send you the earnings report
biotechnology and distillery stocks are up
i'm going to divest odeley from this project
are you sure
because once everything is ready
it might make a fortune
but things have changed
what's wrong, terry
i'll deal with it
it's necessary to check on odeley
i'll check the city plan
if they don't discuss the project honorably
it could be a breakthrough of our investigation
cameron, i'd like you to know my new friend whitney
whitney, this is cameron
hi! nice to meet you
your dress is amazing
this old thing
look at her haircut
oh my god
just like barbra streisand in "the way we were"
which is one of my favorites
honey, i was just about to call you
i killed a litter of birds
what
my robot carried the bird's nest
now the mother bird is staring at me
they can remember people's appearances
i've seen it in documentaries
honey, i'm sure that it was an accident
if we went to watch the game
it wouldn't have happened such an accident
i talked to your lawyer
the judge denied bail
how come
you must be because of the mistakes i've made in the past
so you got implicated
don't worry. everything will be ok
no, it won't, daddy
i did it. i'm guilty
nate
you never did anything wrong
caffrey came out of the e area's bathroom disguised as a guard
where did he get his uniform
from an online uniform customization company
he has a credit card
he used my wife's american express card
we're tracking this account and maybe he'll use it again
he won't
how did he get the key card of the gate
we think that he refactored the public card
he used the original record on the card
vince
could you do me a favor
can you give this to maura when you get back to the station
of course. what's up
i just wanted to thank her for helping me study for the exam
did she help you
she tried her best
but i was hopeless
i dropped out of the study group
i'm sorry
you don't seem happy because of it
i'm really unhappy, i feel terrible
vega's car and search warrant didn't approve
no jury indicted him
what
how could merck prevent the investigation of a jury
he told them to do it after the playoffs
all the top brass told us to leave it alone
say that to ron mckenna's son
i didn't tell you to stop
try to catch vega
jenna, what do you really want
you can't give me what i want
you and your friends are irresponsible
like emily and i said
you are not only irresponsible but also fond of destruction
and you feel like you'll never have to pay a price
we've gotten what we deserved with, jenna
we pay a price every day
how much is the price
is anyone keeping an account
i know you want to be compensated for your imbalance
i can understand that
but i won't let you turn this memorial into our struggle meeting
spencer, i beg you, please
let it go, stop
you can't burn it
i can deal with it in any ways i like in my place
but this may be evidence
i've already paid for ian thomas to be buried
we don't need evidence anymore
please understand me
are you sure that you don't want a cookie
no, thanks
ok
i bought it for sybil
she's my favorite nurse. she is very nice
i know how to repay kindness
i suppose you were surprised to see me, don't you
you are playing with fire
you should come here to talk to me
i just come here to see my friends
it's been a year, we still can't catch anything on her
can we subpoena her phone records
all incoming calls go to the office voicemail
so far we can't connect her to any other numbers
she can also read others' minds
i interrogated her a year ago
she can read out something that my mother doesn't know in five minutes
it's horrible
we have to find her anyway
or she could find us
it's all right, cary. speaking slowly
i know you want to tell us the truth
i wasn't working for the state attorney's office at the time, that's the truth
before you worked at the state attorney's office
how much do you earn at the law firm
eighty-five thousand dollars a year
how much are you making now
thirty-eight thousand dollars a year
but you live in a luxurious apartment
the rent is four thousand dollars a month
a year's rent is higher than your salary
dr. mora, may i trouble you
to take a look at these fingerprints
they're in the van. did you find them
there are actually three of them
you should have read the report, shouldn't you
john pork's fingerprints were on the tank lid
dunn's remains on top of the van
there's an incomplete fingerprint on the rearview mirror
it's probably the driver's
yes
i think he might have a big company or something
so he made me do a paternity test
and signed an agreement that i won't sue him or anything
that's too crazy
like i wanted his money
sign quickly! and leave on his yacht
i still have to see him
why
because both must be present at the same time
so that the sample doesn't get swapped or anything
i know you don't want to contact him
but you have no choice
here's my contact information. call me if you have something
thanks, garrett
thanks to meeting you on the way
me, too
by the way, if you want to have some fun
don't forget me, a big idler
thanks, but i really have something to do
that's ok. get your things done first
he died for excessive loss of blood
two stab wounds in the kidney
it is an extremely painful way to die

everybody uses it here
no. it looks more like a prick
the edges are clean
it is something very sharp
the same as jane
tell me more in details
why do you think this is marketing
we talked about that when we launched the first product
mr. gross is about to launch something new
he is new in the field of personal computing devices

how could he not keep an eye on the prototype
in fact, if you're feeling stressed
you can come and talk to me
i know
sometimes i just forget

did you get the evidence
it's more difficult than we thought
i want to fingerprint patrick's cup
but he made it clean

i don't figure it out
are you suing the gun manufacturer
no, we're suing the designer of the 3d gun
the design defect resulted in my client's disability
what does this have to do with you becoming a state attorney
actions speak louder than words
i've been working on gun control cases like this for many years
but in the same way you have acted many wicked men
like lemond bishop
he's not our client anymore
will you never leave when you come back
thereby hangs a tale
my mother gave up her custody
that cannot be changed
leave it to the lawyer
i should stay until the end of the school year
and then
i'll find out until that time
if you can't take me in
i could completely do something else
jay, come with me to the mall
no, i have a stomachache today
that's a big deal
americans are squeamish
in colombia, something like a cold or a dislocated shoulder
there's no need to go to the hospital
anna, can we have a talk
talk about what
talk about how my best friend and my brother cheated on me
we're not lying to you. we just didn't tell you
is there a difference
do you know what hurts me most
to hear jesse say so many bad things about me
you didn't say a word for me
good friends won't do that

is he a mental breakdown
hip fracture
the first emergency response team said they tried to talk to him
but he said he only talked to policewomen
honey, why are you come back so early
i quit, that guy was a complete pig
he orders me like a servant
totally disrespectful to me
what a pity! you didn't deserve to be treated like that
exactly
what are you going to do
run for state attorney
why
i think i am qualified
what about your own work as a lawyer
i still follow it through the campaign trail on
the cases i have in hand now
but if you win you have to quit
yes, i'll be the state attorney
i only have a few minutes
let's get right to the point
you want my money, don't you
yes
let me give you my reasons
ok
i will reduce the murder rate by aggressively cracking down on gun crime
good, it's really a big problem
and i will work to double the process of prosecutions
you said it
but family
to someone like me is more important than anything else
do you know this man
he's eddie rambo
he works in delari
i interviewed him when i was drawing materials on the book
eddie lamb
spencer talked to him today
she said he wouldn't say anything
he said it's against delarie's rules
he may have changed his mind
but why did he choose you but not spencer
i can't believe this is going to happen to me
you can't give up hope
my only hope is that you are safe
this is the only promise i want you to make
if things get worse i want you to find a way to leave
what does "leave" mean
get away from here, leave here
i want you to take a plane or a boat to
somewhere they can't find you
i can handle it as long as you're safe
i won't do it
i want you to do it
promise me

you wasted time picking out belts that could have taken you home
well, i just can't accept it
our victims have a criminal record

she loves me very much and very strict
it was my mother's blame
that guides the direction of my life
gloria, don't go. listen to me

you're not the first wife to say that
then how many wives do you need to take it in

what matters now is that ellie's killer is dead
we're no longer suspects
