We can discuss it now , right ?
The court hearing is over , we can discuss it .
Yes , we can .
And we can curse in public , do whatever we want .
So everybody can go to the bathroom now , we &apos;ll get right to the point after that .
We need to spend more money .
on a better ballistic expert .
Please , can we ?
I don &apos;t care about the expense .
I have only one kid .
I don &apos;t know if I should ask Bi@@ anca to testify .
Are you ready to inter@@ rogate Bi@@ anca ?
I &apos;m ... ready .
It would made her sad .
Bi@@ anca and her mother wanna talk to us .
Oh my god .
Where &apos;s Kerry ? We need to find him .
Why ?
Only Kerry can talk to her .
Be@@ have yourself and listen to d@@ addy .
I &apos;ll see you tonight .
I can &apos;t take the children to school .
You are always the one who take the children to school .
I have to go to work early today .
Now ? Isn &apos;t it too early ?
It &apos;s not Ju@@ anit@@ a &apos;s fault .
Don &apos;t blame her .
You should blame her parents .
Poor Ju@@ anit@@ a .
Why is this shop out of power ?
Sorry , sir .
It &apos;s okay .
Did@@ n &apos;t you pay the electricity bill ?
Have you found the safe box ?
I can &apos;t wait .
Yes , I have .
And I &apos;ve already opened it .
The Bible just gone with no trace .
Have the police check finger@@ prints in that parish .
I think we &apos;ll find out something .
But why would anyone wanna stole the Bible ?
What happened to her ?
Is she crying ?
Yeah .
She drives me crazy .
I can handle everything except a crying woman .
Who &apos;s the woman asked him to drink ?
I don &apos;t know her . I only know she &apos;s a journalist .
She followed John in the interview .
She wanted to ask him to do a follow@@ -@@ up story .
Here comes a luxury car .
Oh my god . The driver looks familiar .
Does he belong to us ?
Yes , he &apos;s Sam .
Rel@@ ax . He &apos;s nice .
Why are you so down ? What happened ?
I &apos;m so bored .
I need to spend time with a pile of papers entire day .
Neil &apos;s checked all the inform@@ ations of Dur@@ an .
He was un@@ expec@@ te@@ d@@ l@@ ly innocent .
Of course .
How can you doubt Dur@@ an ?
He would never lie .
Maybe you &apos;re right .
I &apos;m Nick , I wanna be your stock@@ broker .
I &apos;ve already got a stock@@ broker .
Really ? How &apos;s his work ?
Has he made you money last year ?
The economic crisis was in last year , nobody could make money .
What are you celebrating ?
We &apos;ve got few games left .
We have nothing to celebrate until next week .
We just want to have a relax .
I think our hard work deserves a little reward .
Is Jones there ? I need him to do me a favor .
He &apos;s not here . What do you need from him ?
Check the finger@@ prints on this for me .
See if we can find the owner of these finger@@ prints .
Okay , Jones &apos;s out . You can find him tomorrow .
Here &apos;s my search warrant .
Who are you looking for ?
I want to find a dealer named Grace ,
who runs a up@@ scale wine cell@@ ar .
I need to find her father through Grace .
I &apos;m going to hold a private wine t@@ asting party .
Can you invite your friends ?
You can contact him directly .
My friend is a cautious person .
He &apos;ll come if you &apos;d tell him more information in person .
No one &apos;s there . That jer@@ k must have seen us .
The monitoring shows that he &apos;s fled the scene .
He &apos;s drove away just two minutes before we blocked the building .
So you have no idea where he is .
We &apos;re monitoring him through a traffic camera .
He didn &apos;t even have time to grab his note@@ ook .
I need to talk to Ivy .
She hasn &apos;t talked to me since last time .
Sorry , Ivy &apos;s not been in a good mood recently . She &apos;s not in the mood of talking .
Even after winning the prize ?
She won a big prize recently .
These things happen . So am I sometimes .
It &apos;s Ryan , do you know him ?
Yeah , he owns a small factory which products children &apos;s toys .
The shop@@ keepers in the city often ask him for cooperation .
Has Neil ever cooperated with him ?
Well , they tried to work together once .
Now Ryan and Neil are friends .
Any information from the head office ?
Intelligence has got it .
What did they get ?
The surveillance video of the restaurant .
Good job . It &apos;s probably Vi@@ x who found it .
Peter , why are you here ?
I happened to go shopping nearby .
I just drop by and invite you to tomorrow &apos;s party .
By the way , is Jenny at home ?
I &apos;ll invite her later .
Yeah , I &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
What happened to Jim ?
He was caught cheating by his teacher in a test .
I can &apos;t believe that he che@@ ated !
His grades &apos;ve always been great .
Yeah , Jim lets his teacher down .
I &apos;ve brought some oil paintings recently , I &apos;ll show you .
All of them are fake .
All ? How did you know ?
The real painting has a special security mark .
I ‘ ve heard it from a expert .
I haven &apos;t seen you so happy for a long time .
Look at you , you &apos;re gr@@ inning your head off .
Because it &apos;s a nice day .
Obviously , it &apos;s because that you &apos;ve received a love letter .
Fine , but love letters do make people happy .
What happened to her recently ?
Someone with bad intentions is looking for her .
Does she know who it is ?
No , she doesn &apos;t , but they &apos;re powerful .
And they almost find her .
Is there anything we can do for her ?
Wow , who painted this picture ? It &apos;s amazing .
Justin .
Justin is terrific .
I &apos;ll find him if I need pictures in the future .
Yeah , me too .
We need an office in our new law firm .
Yes , I &apos;ve been working on this recently .
Did you find it ?
I &apos;m looking for it .
But it &apos;s really hard to find it without a certification .
Jeff@@ ery , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
What do you mean ? Is there anything wrong with me ?
I mean , why are you drunk driving ?
It &apos;s dangerous , don &apos;t you know ?
I &apos;m not drunk .
You &apos;ll be arrested .
Do we have any plan for today ?
How about playing cards ? The weather today is not very nice .
Now ?
Wait , Danny &apos;s not here .
He has a case to deal with .
How &apos;s Al@@ lie recently ?
I don &apos;t know . She &apos;s not in my law firm anymore .
What ? Why did she leave ?
She opened her own law firm .
When is it ?
About three weeks ago .
Do you know that Hayes died of a heart attack ?
I know . But William said it &apos;s a murder .
How does he know that ?
William &apos;s read Hayes &apos; inspection reports ,
which shows there were drug ingredients in his blood .
Peter , tell Andrew it &apos;s dinner time .
I &apos;m afraid that Andrew won &apos;t eat .
What is wrong with him ?
He &apos;s going to have dinner with his classmates tonight .
Okay , fine .
Continue the story you told me last time .
No problem , where were we last time ?
The police issued an arrest warrant .
Oh , right .
Here comes the cli@@ max of the story .
We have a lot of works to do today .
Can we start it now ?
Come on , first of all , you &apos;re responsible for collecting cases .
She consolidated the cases into a report .
B@@ ind them and give them to me before getting off work .
Peter , how about having a cup of coffee ?
Thanks , I don &apos;t need coffee now .
Come on , you &apos;ll need it later .
You might have to work overtime today .
Here is the emergency exit , there is only one entrance to the exhibition hall .
And there is a service channel .
Are you going to ro@@ b the museum ?
How come ?
If you &apos;re not going to ro@@ b the museum , why you have to know these things ?
I just wanna hang out here next week .
Are you agent Jones ? What a coincidence .
John , stop ! Did you follow me here ?
Hur@@ ry up , or I &apos;ll shoot you .
I &apos;m here by the sense of my pants .
Hi , dar@@ ling , how was your day ?
No bad , I caught a bad guy .
Well , how about Jack ?
Not good . He had an accident today .
Ah .
Hi , I &apos;m Rol@@ and .
Are you here to identify the will ?
Yeah , may I see the will ?
They &apos;re on the desk .
Jones , I have something to ask you .
What is it ?
Who &apos;s that girl ?
Cal@@ m down , bud@@ dy . She is an icy beauty .
But I still wanna try .
The Pharmaceu@@ ticals company release a new drug recently .
Anyone in charge of research ?
Jones .
Do we know any related information of the new drug ?
We got everything we could . It &apos;s a new kind of antibiotic to treat infection .
S@@ ounds promising .
When will the party start ?
4 : 00 pm .
You need to get everything done .
The cake , the costume and every@@ ting .
No problem , anything else ?
And call all the guests .
Christie called .
She let me ask you and Susan ,
if you are available for dinner on next weekend .
No problem . Why won &apos;t you come ?
I have something to do .
Who &apos;s that girl ?
Diana .
Did she work here before ?
Yeah , she used to work in law .
And now she was brought here by her boss .
Jack wants to invite you to dinner .
Why ?
Because you did him a favor on last auction .
He wants to pay you back by a nice meal .
Peter seems busy recently .
Yeah , he is cour@@ ting a girl recently .
He is good ,
but still need to work hard if he wants to go further .
Good luck to him .
What do you think of him ?
He doesn &apos;t live a rich life . He has a resentment against the rich .
I think he has moral values , he often give donations .
Don@@ ations ration@@ alize his crime .
And he is arrogant .
He doesn &apos;t know how to stay away troubles while he &apos;s about to be caught .
Why is the shop out of power ?
Yeah , it &apos;s not the first time this week .
I guess they didn &apos;t pay the electricity bill .
What happened to him ?
Is he crying ?
Yeah .
He makes me nervous .
He &apos;s an adult .
Is John satisfied with his job ?
Not really , he &apos;s too bored .
He needs to spend time with a pile of papers entire day .
Did Tom find the safe box ?
I can &apos;t wait .
He got it .
It &apos;s already open .
I haven &apos;t seen Jimmy so happy for a long time .
Look at him . He can &apos;t even close his mouth .
Maybe it &apos;s because today is a nice day .
Because someone had written him a love letter .
Well , love letters do make people happy .
I was guilty of stealing the bi@@ ble .
But why do you steal the bi@@ ble ?
I can &apos;t afford it .
Can you open this safe box ?
Traditional safe boxes are not my strengths .
Learn to be more flexible . I &apos;m not very good at picking locks .
I can only have a try . I &apos;m not sure it &apos;ll work .
Can Jones handcu@@ ff him ?
Give him more time .
I can &apos;t stand him any more .
Trust me , he &apos;s not a bad person .
He can still be corrected .
I hit the jack@@ pot !
Really ? How much did you win ?
A million dollars !
Oh , my god . You &apos;re so lucky . Con@@ grat@@ ulations !
Now there is only one question : what am I going to do with that million dollars ?
Look at my friend .
It looks a little familiar .
Does he look like Mon@@ si@@ eur D@@ up@@ ont or not ?
Oh ! Yes !
I said I feel I have seen him somewhere before .
It &apos;s about time . Let &apos;s go !
Don &apos;t you need to pick R@@ usti@@ e up ?
Is he ready ?
He &apos;s been waiting for us .
Okay , let &apos;s go pick him up .
Does your daughter go this school , too ?
My daughter is a senior now and I worry about her all the time .
Yeah , I always wondering what they &apos;re going to do next .
Your son makes you worry , doesn &apos;t he ?
He is clever but impul@@ sive .
S@@ end your son here and he &apos;ll behave himself .
Don &apos;t run am@@ uck in a Manhattan pre@@ p school .
I &apos;ve lost a lot of money recently .
Where did the money use ?
It &apos;s all in the stock market .
It &apos;ll definitely stand a loss recently . All the people are the same .
But I lost more than most people .
Let &apos;s go inside the stadium and have a look .
You seem to be in a good mood .
My dad took me to a game when I was eight ,
that &apos;s when I decided I wanted to play for the Yankees .
Yeah , that &apos;s what all eigh@@ t@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ olds think .
Neil , it &apos;s your turn , say something about yourself .
When did you come out ?
I came out 18 months and 17 days ago .
I didn &apos;t count them on purpose .
I &apos;ve never been in prison before , it seems not like something fun .
Do you know where Collins is ?
I don &apos;t . I &apos;ll call my husband .
I &apos;m sorry to trouble you , mad@@ am .
Got it . Collins has gone to my house .
Everyone is here already , isn &apos;t it ?
Cook has not yet .
Must we wait for him to get in ?
Yes , we need to act together .
Who has Cook &apos;s number , please call him hurry !
It &apos;s been a busy day and I still haven &apos;t hacked into their main@@ frame .
Have you tried asking Peter for help ?
He did it for me privately last time ,
and he almost lost his job .
Then it seems better to keep Peter out of the affair .
How did the police free Mer@@ rick ?
It &apos;s for the long haul .
You look like you know something . Please tell me .
The sheriff had a plan . Take it easy .
What &apos;s your plan ? I &apos;ll keep it a secret .
Neil suddenly couldn &apos;t open the web page .
Is he connected to the Internet ?
He connects the hotel &apos;s wi@@ fi .
I can open the web page .
Let me ask the hotel staff for him .
Are you a friend of Neil &apos;s ?
You could say that .
Can you get him to drop the charges for you ?
He said I would send him a message if I needed help .
That &apos;s great .
I just got the results of facial recognition .
Who is he ?
Anderson , he was a naval sc@@ out during the gul@@ f war .
Now he was employed by some of the most prominent tech companies for private security .
Why did he hide his security identity ?
Probably because of corporate espionage .
Get your papers in order , Neil .
It &apos;s due today .
No problem .
Can I help you ?
No . I &apos;d better do it myself .
I know how to set Peter free .
It &apos;s a waste of time . If there was a way , I would have found it .
There was a procur@@ ator watching , it &apos;s no use .
If I could trip up the prosecutor ?
I don &apos;t believe you have that kind of influence .
I &apos;m curious about some of your equi@@ p@@ ments .
You can &apos;t check them without a search warrant .
Do you have a supervisor to contact ?
Certainly , I can call the supervisor .
That couldn &apos;t be better .
Did Jones come this morning ?
He came early , in that little room .
In there ?
Yes , that room is warmer .
Let me drive . You &apos;re in a hu@@ ff .
I &apos;m tired of sitting , we &apos;d better walk there .
We seem to be arriving early .
Just enough to catch him off guard .
It will make him more alert .
You &apos;re right , I &apos;ve stolen a lot of things .
But I rarely keep things for myself .
Then you should have a try .
That will soon make you rich .
Hi , what are you doing sitting there ?
I &apos;m waiting for H@@ agen to get off work .
Does he work in the building across the street ?
Yes .
What time does he finish work ?
Another half hour .
How &apos;s Ne@@ al ?
He looks hurt .
Has he learned his lesson ?
It &apos;s hard to say , maybe he has .
Is it a good lesson ?
We &apos;ll find out then .
This task is not easy .
How much time do we have ?
Twenty@@ -@@ four hours .
We didn &apos;t have enough time to check it out to get ready for action .
Unless you go to a place where you &apos;ve already gone .
Cu@@ ffy is climbing the tree again .
Don &apos;t worry , he &apos;s not a child anymore .
What is he doing up there ?
There are other people here . It &apos;s fine .
It seems that Di@@ etr@@ ick &apos;s flight was delayed .
He was getting off the plane with a man in six@@ ties .
Six@@ ties . Who do you think he is ?
Maybe someone he knew on the plane .
Maybe a business partner .
Investigate who he is for me .
What happened ?
Do@@ es@@ n &apos;t my blood tell the story ?
It looks hurting .
Justice is worth any price .
I &apos;ll get you a band@@ -@@ aid to take care of the wound .
Amy said she was hungry . Is there anything to eat ?
Can &apos;t she just eat out by herself ?
Let me go out and buy some .
Why don &apos;t you order her a pizza or something ?
Che@@ ese or pe@@ pper@@ oni ?
Whatever .
Sir , what are we going to do next ?
Investigate this train .
Why ?
Do you really believe he &apos;s going to show up on a Halloween train ,
and disappear into the air ?
Did you hear about Mon@@ a ?
I heard . She didn &apos;t catch the competition once a year .
what a pity . She prepared it for six months .
Don &apos;t you think someone &apos;s plotting against Mon@@ a ?
You mean Lucas .
There &apos;s definitely something wrong with Lucas .
Come and wear this .
It will bring you good luck .
No , I can &apos;t accept this .
What if I lose it ?
Then I &apos;ll lose you , too .
Ha , I &apos;m just kid@@ ding .
Let me tell you something .
What happened ?
The homework that Spencer handed in is awful .
He comes to class every morning with black eyes .
I noticed that , too . He may have been under a lot of pressure recently .
Come on . Can you concentrate on the College En@@ tr@@ ance Examination which in a month ?
This guy is here , can I focus ?
Is Spencer bo@@ thering you ?
He is rec@@ iting the words loudly .
I &apos;ll ask him to go to another room .
Good morning , Ian .
Good morning , would you like juice ?
Why are you being so nice to me ?
Did@@ n &apos;t you buy me coffee last time ?
What &apos;s the password for your personal account ?
Do you need this ? I &apos;m not sure .
This is the bank &apos;s policy . Do you need to make a phone call ?
Just a minute . I &apos;ll contact Jai@@ me .
I wish I could talk to you and my friends .
Why ?
I hope my friends can see your merits , too .
Why do you suddenly care what your friends think of me ?
I hope they like you , too .
You let Mon@@ a go out alone , don &apos;t you afraid that Sl@@ at har@@ ass her ?
Mon@@ a just goes out for shopping .
She will call me if she happens to run into Sl@@ at .
I &apos;d rather you went with her together .
Don &apos;t you want to know the truth ? We &apos;re going to aven@@ ge her .
It won &apos;t bring her back .
No matter what she won &apos;t come back .
We have to focus on protecting the people who are still alive .
Where &apos;s H@@ anna going ?
She said she was having dinner with friends tonight .
How can she not answer my phone ?
Maybe her phone is out of power .
Almost . But I did call her several times .
Spencer , we didn &apos;t finish our conversation last night .
I &apos;m a little busy with my family . I &apos;m sorry .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry if I bothered you .
I &apos;m just a little upset .
I &apos;ll come to you again tomorrow .
He is not suitable for learning now .
But he has to go back to school .
Even if he did , he would be abs@@ ent@@ -@@ minded .
We have to talk to his several teachers .
I already did .
I have &apos;t seen Emily for a long time .
She has been preparing for a competition recently .
Would she come to play at my house before the competition ? She needs to relax .
It probably should be OK . She has no other arran@@ ges , either .
Dad wants me to be with Kate . What do you think ?
I would say no .
Why do you say so ?
Tom is very fond of you .
What are you talking about ?
He &apos;s been waiting for you to come round .
Jackie asked me to tell you something .
Tell me what ?
She threatened to destroy everything about you .
What else ?
She said she was going to get her father to fire you .
That &apos;s why I broke up with Jackie all the time .
How could they do that ? Who could stop them ?
Stop ! They won &apos;t listen .
Do they really think cops are stupid ?
It &apos;ll know who &apos;s stupid when they get arrested .
We &apos;ve been through so much together but you said something I shouldn &apos;t know .
What could I do can make you stay out of my business ?
Tell me what happened the night you got home .
I told you I was set up by others .
How can I trust you when you say that .
Wait a second , are you leaving , too ?
I hope to stay , too , but I have a date with Hor@@ ton .
I thought you weren &apos;t familiar with him .
It wasn &apos;t before .
But who knows we became friends now .
Mr. Mc@@ V@@ eigh is an excellent ball@@ istics expert .
But I think he &apos;s a little conservative .
Why do you say that ?
He is good at analyzing the trajectory of guns but not 3D printed weapons .
Did you notice anything unusual ?
That &apos;s right . Can I demonstrate it ?
I have to admit I &apos;m worried , but go ahead .
Electronic monitoring has recorded evidence of your crimes .
They have no legal force .
Why do they have no legal force ?
The police officer will catch it .
Hor@@ ton , tell me where exactly did H@@ anna go that night ?
Well , why don &apos;t you just ask her ?
Can &apos;t you just tell me ?
She went to the bar with her classmates that night .
Where &apos;s K@@ eller ? I haven &apos;t seen him lately .
He went to Mont@@ ague &apos;s on the weekend .
Did he go to visit his parents ?
Yes .
Life is really hard .
Alison , why are you dressed like this ?
Sho@@ o , less noise .
What are you doing ? Are you playing a game ?
I can tell you but you must keep it a secret .
I was actually sp@@ ying on someone .
Pai@@ ge , do you need my help ?
I &apos;d love to , but I can &apos;t .
The boss will be angry if he sees me idle .
Do@@ es@@ n &apos;t he get annoyed when you chat with other people ?
No , we &apos;re not chatting . We &apos;re talking business .
H@@ anna , is your mother here ?
What can she do for you ?
Please tell your mother to bring you to the police station for a blood test .
Why are you testing my blood ?
There &apos;s new evidence in that case . The blood &apos;s the same type as yours .
Are you doub@@ ting me ?
Do you remember when I helped you into the house ?
I don &apos;t remember .
I helped you to your bed and then I went into the kitchen to get you some water .
And then ?
You were gone when I got back to the room .
Spencer , do you think there are any clues in the room ?
We shouldn &apos;t come in . It &apos;s not safe inside .
Now that we &apos;re in , just look for it .
What are we looking for ?
A red coat .
How was it coming back from New York ?
I &apos;m tired of driving home . I should have taken the train .
How long has it been since you and Mon@@ a last saw each other ?
Almost a month .
Take care of her more . She misses you so much .
Do you know there &apos;s a big news in town recently ?
I don &apos;t know . I haven &apos;t been here lately .
Are you in Washington for the interview ?
I was yesterday . I may go to San Francisco tomorrow .
How I envy you ! Your life is so colorful !
You look a little uncomfortable . Do you need some pain@@ killers ?
What about hydro@@ co@@ done ?
No , I had a bad reaction to that .
It &apos;s not in your case .
I heard that the drug with a bad reaction .
Well , I &apos;ll talk to you when I get the results .
What did she say the other night when you met her ?
She said she left New York and went back to Rose Town .
To see Wil@@ den ?
I don &apos;t know , she didn &apos;t tell me .
I know H@@ anna &apos;s worried about her mother .
But I &apos;m gonna go check on Melissa just like she checked on us .
What are we going to check ?
We must find out what Melissa did that day .
She won &apos;t let us find out .
Someone tried to kill Ellie and bury her in the backyard .
Then someone dug her up like a tur@@ ni@@ p .
Why didn &apos;t she just call the police ?
Which policeman could she call ?
Wil@@ den or Garrett .
We have to let Ellie back .
What are you going to ask her ?
I need to know what &apos;s going on ? Why did she treat us like this ?
Ellie has always liked to play games .
How ? Is she kid@@ ding us ?
Per@@ a has these emails and she &apos;s going to release this report tomorrow .
How can I get the first publish ?
We &apos;re gonna have to find some news tonight if we &apos;re gonna get ahead of her .
Mr. Pol@@ ma , your sister Le@@ ah tried to kill herself a few years ago after a long struggle with drug addiction .
I know your family refused to help her in her last days .
What are you doing ? Do you want to take a hit while we &apos;re not preparing ?
No matter how hard we try , there is nothing we can do .
Any family dealing with addiction knows you &apos;ve done your best .
How long do you want to play like this ?
R@@ hy@@ me ? I &apos;ll have no problem playing all day .
I can see you &apos;re a smart girl with a quick mouth and fighting will .
But it &apos;s no use that you make me angry .
I got a tracking license .
I can track their cell phones and GPS signals from Spencer &apos;s car .
Good . When will we know where they are .
We &apos;ll know it in an hour .
Good , keep me informed .
Emily , my dad wouldn &apos;t let me go out for the night .
So what are you gonna do ?
I have a few ideas .
Can you involve me in the plan ?
I will help you .
Are you OK ? What do you need ?
I need to know that none of this is real , Shan@@ a isn &apos;t dead .
But all these are true .
No , she didn &apos;t .
Spencer , hi !
Eddie , we had not seen for a long time .
Thank you for coming out to see me , I hope I didn &apos;t interrupt your work .
I have a few minutes free .
Great . How have you been ?
Not too bad .
Good morning , Shan@@ a .
Good morning . Is your father at home ?
You just missed him .
Has he gone out yet ?
He just left for work a few minutes ago . What can he do for you ?
Something &apos;s really up .
Sarah , are you okay ?
I &apos;m OK now .
Think about what you &apos;d like to eat tonight , I &apos;ll call for dinner .
Anything is OK as long as someone can deliver the food .
I &apos;ll never leave you alone .
Hi , Alison . I &apos;m Loren@@ zo .
Hav@@ en &apos;t we met somewhere before ?
I was in uniform when we first met .
Oh , I remember .
It &apos;s nice to come across an acquain@@ tance here .
I &apos;m new here , too .
God . Identify results turned out to be Alan .
Is that judge Allen ?
No wonder he refused to sign a search warrant because he was a patient there , too .
Maybe he &apos;s the killer .
Would you like me to go with you ?
No , I can go by myself .
I &apos;m gonna hit the crack button .
Come on .
It doesn &apos;t look good .
Sha@@ wn planted a self@@ -@@ de@@ struc@@ t program in the source code that will empty the memory whenever someone inv@@ ades it .
Maybe I can repeal the instruction .
You should have made a backup before you started .
Jane , do you know who the father is ?
Is that what you want to talk about to me ?
I think you know it .
I didn &apos;t know it before and I don &apos;t know it now .
How can you not know whose child it is ?
I hear Juli@@ et &apos;s coming over here .
Yeah , she &apos;s supposed to be coming for the manus@@ cript .
Have you confirmed the time of her arrival here ?
Maybe she drives here , She wasn &apos;t on the passenger list on any of the flights .
What can I do for you ? Sir .
Can I have dinner here ?
Sure . Would you like a cup of coffee first ?
OK , thank you .
Her preliminary analysis has come out .
Did@@ n &apos;t she d@@ rown ?
She is , but not sea drowning .
Is it soda ?
Neither . What she inhal@@ ed was rain water .
Her autopsy report showed that she had drowned in the rain .
Which means the crime scene we &apos;re looking for has to have a whole bucket of rain .
We know the bodies were thrown into the sea in the harbor .
Yeah , maybe she was killed near the harbor .
Dar@@ ling , did you work overtime again ?
Yes , you &apos;re home , aren &apos;t you ?
I just got home , I went to pick up the baby .
Why are you so early today ?
School came out early because of an emergency .
He couldn &apos;t get away for it .
I d@@ ared to say that yesterday , but I &apos;m not sure today .
Did you let him talk ?
Yeah , he couldn &apos;t even stop .
I &apos;m sorry . I should have give you a cup of tea .
What about the cookies on the desk ?
I ate them all .
Even the chocolate ?
I ate the chocolate first .
He has a low temperature . He must have been sitting here for a while .
That &apos;s today &apos;s newspaper .
He wouldn &apos;t be reading the stock pages while cutting his throat .
The edge of the wound is strange .
The whole thing is strange .
Did you see the man who stabbed her ?
No , he &apos;s far away from me .
Was she conscious when you found her ?
Yeah , she was mo@@ aning then .
When did she stop it ?
Just a few minutes ago .
She &apos;s dead . She lost too much blood .
I ordered some nice dishes for you .
That &apos;s great .
That &apos;s purple cab@@ bage . Nobody used to eat it in salad .
But it &apos;s a nice food now , right ?
Can you quit coffee ?
You have a family history of high cholesterol .
No .
You should go to the hospital .
You &apos;re so no@@ sy .
I care about you .
I think I &apos;ve triggered the power switch .
What if you release it now ?
It &apos;s like a mine , if you &apos;ve stepped on it , it &apos;ll explode if you life your foot .
We need a bomb disposal expert .
You should go , Fro@@ st .
Let &apos;s have dinner now .
Why don &apos;t we call Jon@@ h ?
No problem . Does he know the address ?
I &apos;ve already sent him .
John found a new job .
When ?
I &apos;m not sure . But he packed all his stuff .
Even our trophy .
He can &apos;t take the computer with him , can he ?
Is Lucas your lawyer ?
No . He &apos;s the lawyer at a law firm .
He worked on the How@@ ell &apos;s case before .
Lucas is really a good lawyer .
Is F@@ rit@@ z okay ?
The bullet hit his shoulder . He is undergoing surgery .
When can I talk to him ?
Only when the doctor agrees .
Give me your hand , I have mosquito rep@@ ell@@ ant here .
I don &apos;t need it .
A@@ ren &apos;t these mosquit@@ os bu@@ z@@ zing your mind ?
I &apos;m immune to mosquit@@ os .
Who &apos;s in charge of the on@@ -@@ site report .
Daniel . He just conducted a on@@ -@@ site survey .
Any discovery ?
The victim was a white female , and she &apos;s probably a teenager .
Do you know her name ?
There &apos;s no identification on the victim .
What do you do for entertainment usually ?
I &apos;m a fan of Red Sox .
I don &apos;t know much about baseball .
How can you not love Red Sox while live in this city ?
Tell me about it .
Where &apos;s Nicole ?
She went to catch Alice alone .
Have she caught her ?
Not yet .
Alice is c@@ unning . You should go help her .
What &apos;re you doing ?
Alice &apos;s hiding . I &apos;m trying to figure out where she &apos;s possibly hiding .
Any discoveries ?
It seems that someone &apos;s been helping her .
Are you writing a book ?
Yeah , I just finished a chapter .
Did you put me in the book ? I can be a co@@ star .
You &apos;ll be in the acknowledgement .
Fine . Anyway , don &apos;t make me an English man .
Their music director is suddenly ill .
For no reason ? The show tomorrow is very important .
Maybe I can be their interim music director .
Only by one night ?
I &apos;ll try .
Did you brought the coffee ?
Yeah , I &apos;ll give it to my boss .
Do you know whether he likes tea of coffee ?
As far as I know , he likes them all .
I heard Me@@ il@@ in opened a restaurant nearby .
Yes , it &apos;s Me@@ il@@ in &apos;s .
Have you ever eaten there ?
Yeah , the dum@@ pl@@ ings there is great .
There &apos;s going to be an exhibition tomorrow . Are we going to see it ?
What kind of exhibition ?
The largest pink diamond exhibition in the world .
Did@@ n &apos;t we see it somewhere before ?
We saw it once last year in Paris .
Why is Le@@ ah crying ?
She was e@@ jected from the bak@@ ery .
How could that happen ?
Le@@ ah stole a cake .
That makes sense .
Mom , I &apos;m going to propose to Hal@@ ey .
Not now . You &apos;re still a child .
Not now . Not then . When can I propose to her ?
You can get married to her after her graduation .
Jenny hasn &apos;t seen P@@ addy since that incident .
What &apos;s P@@ addy got to do with it ?
She felt humili@@ ated by Pat@@ ty &apos;s arrival .
She can only blame it on herself .
That &apos;s right .
Look at the girl in white .
The one next to John ?
Yeah , why &apos;s she crying ?
You need to ask John if he broke someone &apos;s heart .
Let &apos;s go and see .
What do you think of Anna ?
I think she is e@@ asy@@ -@@ going .
Don &apos;t you think she &apos;s mysterious ?
Is she from FBI ?
Keep an eye on her recently .
Who &apos;s Neil &apos;s new love ?
T@@ all@@ inn Van der S@@ ent
I &apos;ve never heard of her .
She &apos;s a buyer from that gall@@ ary . She is pretty and nice .
You should encourage Neil if he has a crush on her .
I talked to the spy you sent .
My spy ? What are you talking about ?
Don &apos;t play the fool with me .
You think he &apos;s mine ? I have never hired a spy .
Sorry , what &apos;s your name ?
I &apos;m Mc@@ V@@ eigh .
Oh god , what a unfortunate name .
Sorry , did I bother you ?
No , I &apos;ll call you .
Cav@@ ry &apos;s girlfriend moved out yesterday .
What ? She just left like this ?
They have nothing in common .
Mer@@ ry meet , marry part ?
No , she had a fight with Cav@@ ry .
It &apos;s my honor to meet you .
Me , too . J@@ one .
Welcome to visit my house in the future .
In that case , don &apos;t blame me for my frequent visiting .
You &apos;re welcome .
I have to go . Matthew asked me go back to see him .
What happened to you ?
Matthew blames me for not taking good care of his stuff .
Why ? It &apos;s his own problem .
My job is to take care of these stuff while he &apos;s gone .
Why you broke up with S@@ la ?
It was my mom .
Why ?
My mom used to be mean to S@@ la , and she didn &apos;t allow me to date him .
Why didn &apos;t you come with him ? You can only get freedom by yourself .
These clothes were found in the building . It &apos;s the same as the one Jones usually wears .
Looks like he did it .
It should be Jones . But how did he get out of the building ?
Maybe he found a stuff elevator to the gate .
He is really something .
Hey , Will . Finally I found you .
How did you get here ?
I got a lift from one of your men .
Where did you meet him ?
At the gate of the hotel .
I did the radius screening and checked the traffic videos nearby .
Any discovery ?
I found this .
It &apos;s the black car .
Yeah , we can keep on investigating by the plate number .
Honey , how about school ?
Not bad . I &apos;m star@@ ving . Can I have some cookies ?
Don &apos;t you like my ham sandwich ?
I &apos;m not a fan of ham .
The Gall@@ o is the best restaurant in the city . You &apos;ll see .
Let &apos;s go . I can &apos;t wait .
But I have something for you before leaving .
What is it ?
It &apos;s a piece of j@@ ade .
Oh , it &apos;s so sweet . Thank you .
Why are you han@@ gig out here ?
Jack didn &apos;t answer my call .
I thought he went hiking with friends .
Yeah , I &apos;m a little worried about him .
Don &apos;t worry , he &apos;ll call you when he reaches there .
Honey , did you have a great time in Grand@@ mother &apos;s ?
Yeah , grand@@ ma made a lot of y@@ um@@ my foods for me .
What did she give you ?
She said that I couldn &apos;t tell you .
To ensure the security interest of the country , all meetings must be arranged by American Bar Council .
My friends from the council said they were busy .
But they &apos;ll arrange it for you in next spring if it &apos;s possible .
Thanks for your help . You are awesome .
Ha , it &apos;s my honor .
May I come in ?
Only if your customer comes .
Okay , let me check .
My customer is a cautious person . It &apos;ll be much easier if you can give him the fir@@ st@@ -@@ hand information .
I can give him a brief introduction .
Is it possible to arrest him ?
Jones said he could , but in his own way .
I agree if L@@ ason can be brought to justice .
But it must be legal .
I &apos;ll tell him .
The relationship between me and Ari@@ a has been hard .
I hope she didn &apos;t make our relationship worse .
I believe we can handle this cal@@ mly .
That &apos;s the best way .
So many works , how can I get them done ?
I can get Jenny to help you .
Are you willing to get Jenny back ?
If it helps .
I &apos;ve been researching the video send by the ar@@ son@@ ist .
Any discoveries ?
The video has been modified .
What do you mean ?
If I can get the raw data , I &apos;ll be able to find the location of the publisher .
Re@@ yne gave me a dress .
Why don &apos;t you wear it ?
It &apos;s an ugly dress .
Why don &apos;t you tell Re@@ yne ?
I don &apos;t want make him sad .
Mom , why you &apos;re here ?
What are you doing here ?
We &apos;re just playing cards .
Really ? Why don &apos;t you play at home ?
The te@@ qu@@ ila here is only 5 dollars .
L@@ ena , we need to break up .
Why ? I like you , and I know you like me , too .
Listen .
No , why couldn &apos;t we be together ?
Because I &apos;m not ready .
Do you know the girl in the picture ?
It &apos;s my mom . What is she eating ?
A hot@@ dog .
No way .
Yeah , your mom used to love hot@@ dogs .
But why doesn &apos;t she eat hot@@ dogs anymore ?
Because she &apos;s grown up .
What &apos;s this ?
The Federal Law Enforcement Bureau wants your help . Neil escaped .
Why me ?
Maybe because you &apos;re the only one who &apos;s ever caught him .
You would rather trust your broken tie than Neil ?
The broken tie &apos;s never lied to me .
Why don &apos;t you believe that he &apos;s on the straight ?
It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s not who he is .
You &apos;re too suspicious .
Hold on for a while , everything will be fine .
But what if Bri@@ e is found guilty ?
I don &apos;t know . Let &apos;s talk about it tomorrow .
Have you ever cared about him ?
I don &apos;t want to argue with you anymore . It &apos;s late .
What did the kid say ?
He still wouldn &apos;t say who bullied him . He just asked me to teach him how to fight .
But he &apos;s only 5 years old .
I don &apos;t want him to fight . But every boy would learn how to swing his fist sooner or later .
You know what ? If you want him to win the advantage , you should teach him the ca@@ poe@@ ira .
The cap@@ o what ?
It &apos;s a martial art dance from Brazil .
You look great in the FBI &apos;s coat .
Maybe you need to consider a new career .
No . I &apos;ll stick to my old job .
What are we looking for ?
A tra@@ mp , who &apos;s probably related to the man who killed Paul .
You &apos;re born suspicious .
It &apos;s just occupational disease . I just like to be safe .
I know . But sometimes you need to take a chance .
Maybe .
Is everything ready ?
Only your money left .
As far as I know , the security system of F@@ ED is un@@ assail@@ able .
Yeah , it &apos;s also the most un@@ assail@@ able security system in the world .
But you &apos;ve taken 60 million dollars out of there .
That car looks familiar .
Yes , we met it when we came in .
We need to find out who they are .
Maybe a rival buyer of the chip .
Let &apos;s get closer and hear what they &apos;re saying .
Where &apos;s B@@ art ?
He must have gone to buy the lottery again .
What would he do if he hit it ?
The first thing he would do is to buy a road@@ ster .
Is it the val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s gift you received ?
It &apos;s from Neil .
You look wonderful in this dress .
If only I could wear it on the runway tomorrow .
Maybe some@@ day .
I need you to do something .
What ?
I need you to get Ch@@ ole &apos;s attention .
How &apos;s it possible ? She treats me like I &apos;m not exist .
You need to take the initiative .
Mr. Senator , I &apos;m the special agent Peter .
Hi , Peter .
Thanks for your time .
How could I say no to the requests of the law@@ -@@ enforcing ag@@ ence ?
I have something to ask Mr. Senator .
Will , listen !
I know you &apos;ve done your best .
There &apos;s no need to say this .
Let &apos;s have a dinner in a week .
Let &apos;s talk about it again later .
Now , go to your bedroom !
Are you ready ?
Do you want to vote first ?
Yes , that &apos;s a good idea .
And everyone here takes a note .
You have to examine your own conscience when you vote .
The young girl ,
would she make a hear@@ tless killing ？
Are you the leader here ?
Yes . What &apos;s the problem ?
The problem is that Mr. An@@ ders is Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Diplomatic Cou@@ rier &apos;s son .
So the Diplomatic immunity existed .
I wasn &apos;t here at that time .
Do you need any help ?
No .
If you have any IT problems , please contact me instantly .
But not repair it without any minds yourself .
You &apos;ve made an awful mess like this .
Do you want to stroll around the lake for coming across your ex@@ -@@ wives ?
No , I &apos;m looking for you .
Your colleagues said you &apos;d be here .
How did the presidential election go ?
Why are you asking ? What have you heard ?
You over@@ thought it .
So you and Mr. Gordon were husband and wife ?
Four years are good , eight years are ok , two years are bad .
I hope it doesn &apos;t make me un@@ elec@@ table .
I &apos;m just here to ask some questions and not to evaluate .
So why did you break up ？
That was written in the divorce agreement .
No , it just says &quot; ir@@ reconc@@ il@@ able . &quot;
Yes . That &apos;s right .
I was thinking , Ms. G@@ ob@@ anza .
Who the hell are you working for ?
Of course ... The governor .
Then why are you hiding the truth ?
You &apos;re actually here to probe
Peter &apos;s speech on Internet Business Tax@@ ation .
I ...
I got a message .
Someone called my office anonym@@ ously ,
who claiming that Peter took advantage of the governor &apos;s words to help you .
Can you tell me what happened on the night of the murder ?
We were having a b@@ acc@@ arat at that time .
Sorry , I don &apos;t understand .
⁣ What is a b@@ acc@@ arat ?
⁣ It is hold by the whole neighborhood down the street ,
each family prepare a definite dish .
⁣ That sounds interesting .
You can &apos;t have fun without cooking .
They ski@@ pped my house that night .
Please , I want to be alone .
You gotta tell me what happened .
I told you before .
I was desperate that time and now I started drinking again .
All my friends have deserted me .
But I didn &apos;t kill anyone .
You have to believe me .
I believe you .
I just hope the jury believes it , too .
David , come to check monthly , no arguments .
Got it , doctor .
But you really don &apos;t have to worry about me . I am very good .
I &apos;ll have an interview with you in a month .
Please tell me .
What am I supposed to say ,
you will let me out .
David , you &apos;ve been here for six months .
There &apos;s not the s@@ lightest improvement in your mental state .
I adjusted and I think I &apos;m normal .
You weren &apos;t convicted because you volunteered to go to the hospital .
If I don &apos;t see you getting any better ,
I &apos;m not going to allow you to leave the hospital .
I have a stom@@ ach@@ ache .
Then you eat The Best .
Well , I &apos;d better not .
At present , Helen has found out .
Those numbers are the serial numbers of the Best sample .
She was on her way to pick up the memo .
I was shocked that she was that kind of person
who wants results at all costs .
This bo@@ thers me a lot .
Sullivan knew she was researching the company .
And she must find out what he has hidden .
What do you know about K@@ eller ?
He is a good chess player .
He would make ten or even twelve moves in advance .
So everything they did :
they sent the helicopter , agents went from house to house ...
He would predict .
they did not know his purpose .
Yes .
How close does it have to be for this thing to work ?
A distress call from a submarine .
is designed to be passive ,
which means we have to stand on the submarine
that it can detect it .
I hate to bring you and that thing
bum@@ ming around the East Coast .
If Alex knows as much as we think ，
can she help us narrow down the search scope ?
It &apos;s worth a try .
Have you ever heard of a doub@@ le@@ -@@ edged sword ?
That &apos;s the weapon you &apos;re holding right now .
What else do you know about this weapon , John ?
What &apos;s special about this weapon ?
It was eight years ago that Holt and I stole it for you .
In New York .
You &apos;re holding it in a wrong way .
Give it to me .
The upper part of the handle of the early doub@@ le@@ -@@ edged knife should be 5 cm wide .
Gri@@ p it like this .
A better grip means a quicker swing ,
a better control .
You &apos;re right .
Do you recognize this ?
It &apos;s the work of William Blake , if I remembered correctly .
Jud@@ gment Day is very appropriate .
More like a rush to judgment day .
This painting is a for@@ g@@ ery .
You have no proof that I f@@ aked this .
Not necessarily .
Why should I be so rash ?
Because you &apos;re out of jail , I think .
Remember to res@@ ell it .
Ear@@ n a quick buck .
Are you saying I &apos;m going to run ?
William , I know when you occurred something hard to understand ,
you would like to make up stories .
But you can &apos;t sp@@ it it out .
My feelings with Jack are real .
Your love are as real as his lim@@ p .
You forced me to expose you in public .
Do you see the bending marks on the edges ?
I think he took it out of his wallet .
Why does he have a picture of me in his wallet ?
I think there &apos;s an explanation .
The man holding you ,
the ring ,
Jamie is wearing the same ring today .
He knew you before you were five .
That &apos;s impossible .
Dear , is this the new car you bought ?
I know it doesn &apos;t seem practical .
But Andre told me a lot about dying people .
I &apos;m not unhappy
I &apos;m not angry , this car is beautiful .
Just surprised you didn &apos;t buy a big car that &apos;s all
Do you know what LD@@ 50 is ?
Mr. Swe@@ eney .
It &apos;s called the half lethal dose .
De@@ signed by Cre@@ x@@ en@@ -@@ Brand@@ t Company ,
which used to test the toxicity of a drug .
If you poison less than half of the lab animals ,
it &apos;s a sign of success .
Why do you suddenly care about animal experiments ?
Can &apos;t I have compassion in my heart ?
Peter wants me to cheat a widow .
There are two kinds of widows in the world .
The gri@@ ef@@ -@@ stricken and the relief .
What kind did he let you play ?
The kind that gets targeted for $ 50 million .
Is she Sophie Co@@ v@@ ington ?
Is she a murderer ?
No , she isn &apos;t .
Do you want to say after sitting ?
I don &apos;t want to say it here . I hope you don &apos;t mind .
Now that you &apos;re here , just tell me .
I know this is old history .
But I need to clarify one thing .
I was really angry when I found that you were with my dad .
I broke into his office .
You don &apos;t have to recount the details of your glorious deeds .
I talked to your father this morning .
I vivi@@ dly remember the threat he left on my vo@@ ic@@ email .
Okay ,
I &apos;m very sorry .
Can you give me a glass of water ? Thank you ！
OK .
Maybe you should go out for a walk .
These pills will knock me out for a while .
You don &apos;t have to be here watching me dro@@ ol while I sleep .
Clear your mind , and the spare keys are there .
I &apos;ll wash the dishes first ,
and maybe the clothes next .
Really , I don &apos;t mind staying .
Did they introduce Resid@@ ential ownership rate into the algorithm ?
No , they considered doing so .
So what , they didn &apos;t do it .
Come on .
They talked about that in the design of security filters ,
which introduced the residential ownership rate ,
That is to say that it automatically puts poorer neighbourhoods at a disadvantage .
This is racism in disguise .
Yes , but again they didn &apos;t introduce it .
So it &apos;s not discrimination .
Let &apos;s leave it to the judge to decide .
Hey , everyone .
We are going to see the biggest ban@@ yan tree in the world .
Does anyone want to join us ?
Who will eat all the mind to leave this fair@@ yland
to take a sw@@ el@@ tering ride just in order to see a tree .
One of the things I admire most about Cameron
is that he was as adven@@ turous as I was .
We all like to do as the Rom@@ ans do ,
learn more about the local people .
It &apos;ll be all right .
We have to trust Jane can take care of herself .
Yes .
I remember when she was about five ,
I looked out of the kitchen window ,
she is climbing a small tree ,
the small tree sw@@ ayed even a bird in it .
What about later ?
She fell from a height of three meters ,
by the time I got to the back yard ,
she was already chasing Frank@@ ie and Tommy around the house .
I &apos;m sorry the security is so te@@ dious .
Because we can &apos;t let visitors take any sensitive information with them .
I see .
You can go to the front desk when you leave .
Get your phone and laptop back .
This way , please .
Thank you .
I &apos;m sorry we can &apos;t give you a gate card ,
only regular employees can have .
The President &apos;s office is just around the corner .
I think in your un@@ ru@@ ly youth ,
you should have stayed in countless hotels .
I seldom stay in one place .
What &apos;s different about this hotel ?
It &apos;s an architecture at the height of the Renaissance ,
there &apos;s also a jac@@ u@@ zz@@ i and a hot stone massage .
If There is a next life I will settle there .
Perfect . Then why did you leave ?
I got word that Euro@@ pol was on their ways ,
They think I did it in Cor@@ s@@ ica .
You can go back to school if you would like to .
The problem is I don &apos;t want to come back .
Is there anything you expect from a class reunion ? I don &apos;t .
And I got a job .
Look .
They hire full@@ -@@ time workers .
I can learn from the best person .
Swe@@ eney built half the houses in this town .
What do your parents think about it ?
I do this just because of my family .
The sooner I make money the sooner I can get out of there .
Emily , have you finished packing your closet ?
Still in finishing .
I &apos;m thinking about what I don &apos;t take .
Baby we &apos;re not moving to the moon .
Just put them in the storage room .
Do you want to answer the phone ?
It &apos;s Pai@@ ge . I &apos;ll call her later .
How long did he stay in jail ?
Three weeks .
What crime ?
Pos@@ session of drugs .
Pos@@ session of grade B cocaine is a misdemean@@ or .
He was jailed here until he was released on $ 5,000 bail .
Looks like he &apos;s paying for it with his life .
There &apos;s about three lit@@ ers of blood here .
It &apos;s a miracle he made it to the in@@ fir@@ mary .
Because he is young and strong .
Okay , is here no cameras ?
No cameras in the release area .
Well , you might reconsider it .
The first time we ate out ,
you ask me what I &apos;m up to .
And when the first time we kissed ,
I realized I had nothing
except you .
Now I want to ask you if you would like to venture with me again ,
Sarah Ellis , will you marry me ?
Yes , I will .
Sorry , I have no purpose to interrupt you .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
I didn &apos;t expect to see you under such circumstances .
Have you been here before ?
No . Never .
That looks good , what &apos;s that ?
Boy@@ sen@@ berries .
Maybe they are black@@ berries .
I don &apos;t know , either .
The wa@@ iter recommended it to me .
What &apos;s the matter ?
I just found that my cousin , 23 years ago ,
was born in a san@@ atorium ,
the adoption process was completed here .
I don &apos;t know the sex but I know the name of the birth mother .
Can I get a copy of the adoption records ?
No , you &apos;re neither an adop@@ tee
nor his parents .
I know , but we don &apos;t know who the father is ,
The mother is also missing .
I hope I can help you , too .
Actually you can give a hand .
Who is that ?
David Sutton who is 35 years old .
He teaches science and driving in a high school .
What a cruel irony !
The driving teacher died in a hit@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ run .
When school just started ,
the ground@@ s@@ keeper found him in the bus@@ hes .
What do you think ? An accident or a murder ?
I &apos;m not sure . Fro@@ st , follow me .
I think he was hit here .
Take a photo .
Do you know these two men ?
Should I know them ?
They were
regul@@ ars at the neighborhood shelter .
If so , they probably go to Sea Ur@@ ch@@ ins a lot .
Is it a bar ?
Yes . It &apos;s where all the tram@@ ps go .
The bar@@ tender c@@ ashes their Social Security checks .
Sometimes they even let you take a shower there .
O@@ k . Thank you .
I haven &apos;t thought about Mary Drake for many years .
She is lovely .
What else can you tell us ?
She lacks common sense and discrimin@@ ability .
That &apos;s for sure .
How do you say that ?
I used to be an acc@@ ou@@ che@@ ur .
I &apos;ve dealt with Mary &apos;s two children .
Did Matt &apos;s autopsy report come out yet ?
Yes . I &apos;m still waiting for the poison test and the micro@@ scopic report .
But I &apos;m sure that
he did not die of natural causes .
Really ?
That &apos;s an amazing discovery .
Why don &apos;t you two go to sleep ?
There is a murder trial tomorrow morning .
We worry about that and can not fall asleep .
Don &apos;t worry , B@@ ree is innocent .
The jury will understand that
they are mistaken .
Let &apos;s just say we &apos;re worried about B@@ ree
but it doesn &apos;t help .
I &apos;ve been wondering if we should stand out and help her .
Con@@ f@@ ess the truth to the judge .
I have the same thought as you .
Wait , Miss . You have to sign it .
I &apos;m just leaving .
You sit there and drink a cup of coffee .
So you &apos;re a visitor .
What do you think this sign says ?
All visitors must sign in .
Peter , I haven &apos;t asked him about the Welsh gold .
Why not ask ?
Only the charge of arms trafficking
is enough to judge him for a while .
Dec@@ ker signed a deal .
He &apos;ll try to get away with buying and selling guns ,
gold coins can be used as our jet@@ ton .
All right .
Do you want me to come in with you ?
No .
You made a public statement two years ago .
You &apos;re an athe@@ ist .
Are you still insisting that ?
Do I think I am an athe@@ ist ?
You insisted on saying yes at that time .
That does sound like me .
My life has changed a lot in the past few years .
You mean the affair of your husband ?
Yes and everything else .
If you had asked me six years ago : what will I do today ?
I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m running for state attorney .
Yes , life makes one humble .
I cr@@ inge at the thought of taking a flight .
What are you talking about ? You &apos;ve flown a lot .
Yes , it &apos;s only started from recent few years .
I think the reason why I feel nervous is that
maybe there are so many things I can &apos;t put down now .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Cat@@ ch your breath and do not think about your vacation .
The vacation hasn &apos;t started yet .
I mean , I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll be peaceful by then .
A pig roast , then a mountain climb and a show later .
A@@ ren &apos;t you happy that we &apos;re all coming here with you ?
It &apos;s just a little different from my original intention .
You can &apos;t leave without saying a word !
You can &apos;t do that again .
Especially after what happened last night .
I &apos;m afraid he &apos;ll catch you ,
or hurt you or even worse .
The picture in my mind was horri@@ bly real .
I &apos;m in town , Spencer .
I &apos;m right here .
But I didn &apos;t know you were here .
Your honor , they &apos;ve found your party guilty four times before ,
which makes that I was unable to reach an effective defense .
You know they &apos;re just playing tricks .
Obj@@ ection !
That is a perfectly reasonable request , your honor .
She asked to check the S@@ K@@ U of the swe@@ ater .
What is the S@@ K@@ U ?
Inven@@ tory components , your honor .
Every item will have an electronic logo on it
to prevent theft .
I &apos;m surprised that you came back .
Why didn &apos;t you call me in advance ?
I &apos;ve been to your place .
Did@@ n &apos;t Alicia tell you ?
No .
We have a case for you .
Are you sure ?
I think Alicia &apos;s worried about the money .
What &apos;s the price ?
Increase the price by $ 20 .
She said she wanted to confirm with you .
Three years ago , he was their school &apos;s
ed@@ it@@ or@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ chief of the school newspaper .
Among the staff@@ s , there was a freshman named Penny Williams .
She committed suicide .
She had won the &quot; Fron@@ t@@ -@@ Run@@ ner &quot; award ,
which equivalent of the Nobel Prize for journalism .
Being a journalist is her dream .
I think he ruined her dream .
Don &apos;t you think that he killed her ?
Yes , but I think her breakdown had something to do with him .
Because his position is threatened .
The rest of the staff@@ s had 10 or 15 papers published but Penny had only two .
It &apos;s too few for a nationally recognized talent .
Yes , there is something &apos;s wrong .
Today is an important day .
I have saw it .
You &apos;re wearing your lucky tie .
Hey , did you find the Bible ?
Yes , at the professor &apos;s .
Neil will go to buy it .
Then you have to give him money .
No wonder you wear your lucky tie .
No way . We &apos;re going to make a fake transfer .
Let &apos;s play cards !
I don &apos;t really want to play , mom .
Are you afraid to lose ?
You haven &apos;t beaten me since I was in primary school .
I &apos;m gonna take advantage of your weakness
to win a few times .
All right .
I talked to the fierce Ko@@ ss@@ ack .
You &apos;ve been leaking to the press about what &apos;s going on
of the murder investigation information .
This is likely to affect the investigation .
I didn &apos;t let any information out .
You used your work computer to send emails .
Oh , yes , I did .
I told my cousin something .
He has a crime blog , it was posted by him .
This is called leakage .
No , I just talked to my relatives about work .
Is that what you &apos;re going to defend ?
Yeah , is that enough ?
No , it isn &apos;t .
You &apos;re out of luck .
Why did that fool break up with you ?
He said it was because I was too cl@@ ing@@ y .
But seriously speaking ,
I think he wants to look for an older girl .
He is at university .
What about you ?
We really didn &apos;t fit , so ...
I might look like a mess now .
Is my mas@@ car@@ a running down ?
A little bit .
Can you help me er@@ ase it ?
You used to work here , didn &apos;t you ? Miss Fr@@ ith .
Yes , as an inter@@ n two years ago .
Do you want to come back to work ?
No .
Just a joke .
For warming up .
Well ... What can we do for you ?
It &apos;s very late . Are you waiting for someone ?
Yes , Hughes . I have business to talk about .
What business calls for a personal visit from the boss ?
An undercover police for decades . There is an organized crime and two murders .
It &apos;s not just involves C@@ aff@@ rey and his father .
This is public corruption .
We need to arrest Pl@@ ath .
He has a lot of power .
I know that .
Do you have any plans ?
I want to e@@ av@@ es@@ drop on him while he &apos;s in New York .
This must be h@@ ushed up .
I am is Nick How@@ den and I &apos;d like to be your stock@@ broker .
I had an agent .
Really ? How did he do ?
Did he make any money for you last year ?
Who made money last year ?
No no .
If you hire me , you &apos;ll net three percent
after the crash .
I don &apos;t believe .
Then give me your email address .
I &apos;ll send you the earnings report .
Bi@@ otechnology and dis@@ till@@ ery stocks are up .
I &apos;m going to di@@ vest O@@ del@@ ey from this project .
Are you sure ?
Because once everything is ready ,
it might make a fortune .
But things have changed .
What &apos;s wrong , Terry ?
I &apos;ll deal with it .
It &apos;s necessary to check on O@@ del@@ ey .
I &apos;ll check the city plan .
If they don &apos;t discuss the project hon@@ or@@ ably ,
it could be a breakthrough of our investigation .
Cameron , I &apos;d like you to know my new friend Whit@@ ney .
Whit@@ ney , this is Cameron .
Hi ! Nice to meet you .
Your dress is amazing .
This old thing ?
Look at her hair@@ cut .
Oh my god !
Just like Bar@@ bra Stre@@ is@@ and in &quot; The Way We Were &quot; ,
which is one of my favor@@ ites .
Honey , I was just about to call you !
I killed a litter of birds .
What ?
My robot carried the bird &apos;s nest .
Now the mother bird is staring at me .
They can remember people &apos;s appearances .
I &apos;ve seen it in docu@@ ment@@ aries .
Honey , I &apos;m sure that it was an accident .
If we went to watch the game ,
it wouldn &apos;t have happened such an accident .
I talked to your lawyer .
The judge denied bail .
How come ?
You must be because of the mistakes I &apos;ve made in the past ,
so you got implicated .
Don &apos;t worry . Everything will be ok .
No , it won &apos;t , d@@ addy .
I did it . I &apos;m guilty .
Nate .
You never did anything wrong .
C@@ aff@@ rey came out of the E area &apos;s bathroom disguised as a guard .
Where did he get his uniform ?
From an online uniform custom@@ ization company .
He has a credit card .
He used my wife &apos;s American Express Card .
We &apos;re tracking this account and maybe he &apos;ll use it again .
He won &apos;t .
How did he get the key card of the gate ?
We think that he re@@ fac@@ tored the public card .
He used the original record on the card .
Vince .
Could you do me a favor ?
Can you give this to Maur@@ a when you get back to the station ?
Of course . What &apos;s up ?
I just wanted to thank her for helping me study for the exam .
Did she help you ?
She tried her best .
But I was hop@@ eless .
I dropped out of the study group .
I &apos;m sorry .
You don &apos;t seem happy because of it .
I &apos;m really unhappy , I feel terrible .
Veg@@ a &apos;s car and search warrant didn &apos;t approve .
No jury indicted him .
What ?
How could Merc@@ k prevent the investigation of a jury ?
He told them to do it after the playoffs .
All the top brass told us to leave it alone .
Say that to Ron McK@@ enna &apos;s son .
I didn &apos;t tell you to stop .
Try to catch Veg@@ a .
J@@ enna , what do you really want ?
You can &apos;t give me what I want .
You and your friends are irresponsible .
Like Emily and I said ,
you are not only irresponsible but also fond of destruction .
And you feel like you &apos;ll never have to pay a price .
We &apos;ve gotten what we deserved with , J@@ enna .
We pay a price every day .
How much is the price ?
Is anyone keeping an account ?
I know you want to be compensated for your imbalance ,
I can understand that ,
but I won &apos;t let you turn this memorial into our struggle meeting .
Spencer , I beg you , please .
Let it go , stop !
You can &apos;t burn it .
I can deal with it in any ways I like in my place .
But this may be evidence .
I &apos;ve already paid for Ian Thomas to be buried .
We don &apos;t need evidence anymore .
Please understand me .
Are you sure that you don &apos;t want a co@@ okie ?
No , thanks .
O@@ k .
I bought it for Sy@@ bil .
She &apos;s my favorite nurse . She is very nice .
I know how to repay kindness .
I suppose you were surprised to see me , don &apos;t you ?
You are playing with fire .
You should come here to talk to me !
I just come here to see my friends .
It &apos;s been a year , we still can &apos;t catch anything on her .
Can we sub@@ po@@ ena her phone records ?
All incoming calls go to the office vo@@ ic@@ email .
So far we can &apos;t connect her to any other numbers .
She can also read others &apos; minds .
I interrog@@ ated her a year ago .
She can read out something that my mother doesn &apos;t know in five minutes .
It &apos;s horrible .
We have to find her anyway ,
or she could find us .
It &apos;s all right , C@@ ary . Speaking slowly .
I know you want to tell us the truth .
I wasn &apos;t working for the state Attorney &apos;s Office at the time , that &apos;s the truth .
Before you worked at the state Attorney &apos;s office ,
how much do you earn at the law firm ?
Eigh@@ ty@@ -@@ five thousand dollars a year .
How much are you making now ?
Thir@@ ty@@ -@@ eight thousand dollars a year .
But you live in a luxurious apartment .
The rent is four thousand dollars a month .
A year &apos;s rent is higher than your salary .
Dr. Mor@@ a , May I trouble you
to take a look at these finger@@ prints ?
They &apos;re in the van . Did you find them ?
There are actually three of them .
You should have read the report , shouldn &apos;t you ?
John Por@@ k &apos;s finger@@ prints were on the tank lid .
Dunn &apos;s remains on top of the van .
There &apos;s an incomplete finger@@ print on the re@@ ar@@ view mirror .
It &apos;s probably the driver &apos;s .
Yes .
I think he might have a big company or something .
So he made me do a pat@@ ernity test .
And signed an agreement that I won &apos;t sue him or anything .
That &apos;s too crazy .
Like I wanted his money .
Sign quickly ! And leave on his yacht .
I still have to see him !
Why ?
Because both must be present at the same time
so that the sample doesn &apos;t get sw@@ apped or anything .
I know you don &apos;t want to contact him ,
but you have no choice .
Here &apos;s my contact information . Call me if you have something .
Thanks , Garrett .
Thanks to meeting you on the way .
Me , too .
By the way , if you want to have some fun ,
don &apos;t forget me , a big id@@ ler .
Thanks , but I really have something to do .
That &apos;s ok . Get your things done first .
He died for excessive loss of blood .
Two stab wounds in the kidney .
It is an extremely painful way to die .
Yes , but it &apos;s fast . It only needs a sharp weapon .
Everybody uses it here .
No . It looks more like a pr@@ ick .
The edges are clean .
It is something very sharp .
The same as Jane .
Tell me more in details .
Why do you think this is marketing .
We talked about that when we launched the first product .
Mr. Gross is about to launch something new .
He is new in the field of personal computing devices .
He invested $ 800 million for it .
How could he not keep an eye on the prototype ?
In fact , if you &apos;re feeling stressed ,
you can come and talk to me .
I know .
Sometimes I just forget .
I don &apos;t have to solve all the problems alone .
If you can &apos;t gossip with your friends at any time ,
what do you need friends for ?
I thought the point was that we could support each other .
That &apos;s fine , but it &apos;s fun to gossip !
Did you get the evidence ?
It &apos;s more difficult than we thought .
I want to finger@@ print Patrick &apos;s cup .
But he made it clean .
Are you sure ?
Yes .
The comb is clean .
The tooth@@ brush and raz@@ or have been cleaned .
Everything is spot@@ less .
Either this guy &apos;s a fre@@ ak with a clean fre@@ ak ,
or he had an excuse that he has to live without a trace .
I don &apos;t figure it out .
Are you suing the gun manufacturer ?
No , we &apos;re suing the designer of the 3D gun .
The design defect resulted in my client &apos;s disability .
What does this have to do with you becoming a state attorney ?
Actions speak lou@@ der than words .
I &apos;ve been working on gun control cases like this for many years .
But in the same way you have acted many wicked men .
Like Lem@@ ond Bishop .
He &apos;s not our client anymore .
Will you never leave when you come back ?
There@@ by hangs a tale .
My mother gave up her custody .
That cannot be changed .
Leave it to the lawyer .
I should stay until the end of the school year .
And then ?
I &apos;ll find out until that time .
If you can &apos;t take me in ,
I could completely do something else .
Jay , Come with me to the mall .
No , I have a stom@@ ach@@ ache today .
That &apos;s a big deal .
Americans are squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish .
In Colombia , something like a cold or a dis@@ located shoulder ,
there &apos;s no need to go to the hospital .
Anna , can we have a talk ?
Talk about what ?
Talk about how my best friend and my brother che@@ ated on me ?
We &apos;re not lying to you . We just didn &apos;t tell you .
Is there a difference ?
Do you know what hurts me most ?
To hear Jesse say so many bad things about me .
You didn &apos;t say a word for me .
Good friends won &apos;t do that .
The goal is the v@@ ault on the eighth floor of The Rein@@ hardt Building .
What &apos;s in there ?
Gold coins .
They are made of Welsh gold .
It &apos;s worth three times the average gold .
That &apos;s all Wales is worth .
Choo@@ se other ways to make money .
No , that &apos;s what I want .
I &apos;m in debt . This is part of the debt .
What do we know about the gun@@ bearer ?
His name is Gro@@ f@@ ner .
He is a 7@@ 2@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old retired engineer who lives alone without relatives .
Is he doing any drug therapy ?
He doesn &apos;t trust doctors .
The last time he saw a doctor was six months ago in the emergency room .
Is he a mental breakdown ?
Hi@@ p fracture .
The first emergency response team said they tried to talk to him ,
but he said he only talked to polic@@ e@@ women .
Honey , why are you come back so early ?
I quit , that guy was a complete pig .
He orders me like a servant ,
totally dis@@ respectful to me .
What a pity ! You didn &apos;t deserve to be treated like that .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
What are you going to do ?
Run for state attorney .
Why ?
I think I am qualified .
What about your own work as a lawyer ?
I still follow it through the campaign trail on
the cases I have in hand now .
But if you win you have to quit .
Yes , I &apos;ll be the state attorney .
I only have a few minutes .
Let &apos;s get right to the point .
You want my money , don &apos;t you ?
Yes .
Let me give you my reasons .
OK .
I will reduce the murder rate by aggressively cracking down on gun crime .
Good , it &apos;s really a big problem .
And I will work to double the process of prosecutions .
You said it !
But family
to someone like me is more important than anything else .
Do you know this man ?
He &apos;s Eddie Ram@@ bo .
He works in Del@@ ari .
I interviewed him when I was drawing materials on the book .
Eddie Lam@@ b ?
Spencer talked to him today .
She said he wouldn &apos;t say anything .
He said it &apos;s against del@@ arie &apos;s rules .
He may have changed his mind .
But why did he choose you but not Spencer ?
I can &apos;t believe this is going to happen to me .
You can &apos;t give up hope .
My only hope is that you are safe .
This is the only promise I want you to make .
If things get worse I want you to find a way to leave .
What does &quot; leave &quot; mean ?
Get away from here , leave here .
I want you to take a plane or a boat to
somewhere they can &apos;t find you .
I can handle it as long as you &apos;re safe .
I won &apos;t do it .
I want you to do it .
Pro@@ mise me .
My God . Look ! Maur@@ a .
There ! There are hor@@ ses@@ hoe cra@@ bs ！
Where is it ?
It &apos;s over there ！
Yeah , I saw one over there , too .
Hor@@ ses@@ hoe cra@@ bs have not been seen in Dor@@ chester Bay for 25 years .
They come back !
Look ! there &apos;s one over there , too !
Be careful ! They are endangered species .
The first murder in the history of the Massachusetts Marathon happened just now .
It was a shooting accident .
Did we catch the murder ?
No . R@@ izz@@ oli and Dr. A@@ yers got there first .
R@@ izz@@ oli got things under control .
Very good .
Although she is disgusting , she &apos;s a good cop .
It was lucky to have a medical exam@@ iner on the spot .
O@@ k .
So we &apos;re going to close the bridge .
You got what you wanted .
Today &apos;s task is done .
Don &apos;t f@@ rown , say cheese .
You take line 15 and go home .
Hold that bag with both hands .
The bus goes through a few unsafe blocks .
A@@ ren &apos;t you going to drive me home ?
You wasted time picking out belts that could have taken you home .
Well , I just can &apos;t accept it .
Our victims have a criminal record .
Why was she arrested ?
They &apos;re basically misdemean@@ ors .
Several times of drunken disturbances .
There was also a small charge of drug possession .
Both in Atlanta .
Do@@ es@@ n &apos;t she have a local one ?
No .
I can &apos;t find her Boston address
or her work records from the state .
All right , call the Atlanta PD and see if we can find out more about her .
I remembered you said your mother was sof@@ tening a little about us being together .
She &apos;s un@@ freezing .
What about your father ?
How long will it take for the gl@@ acier to melt ?
very slow .
That &apos;s why we call it the gl@@ acial epo@@ ch .
Do you know what that means ?
That means we have to produce a little more heat .
I was arrested four months ago .
I was charged with fir@@ st@@ -@@ degree murder .
My god !
I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s the same case .
What do you mean by &quot; the same case &quot; ?
The one in which you got me off .
They want to judge me again .
They can &apos;t do that .
You &apos;ve been acquitted .
You &apos;re in big trouble !
Don &apos;t you think that I know it ?
What should I do ?
You &apos;ll get what you deserve .
Par@@ king violations are second only to driving violations .
Dri@@ ving offences can result in deprivation of driving privileges .
It &apos;s a privilege , not a right .
My God . Sh@@ ut up !
Do you want to be a father ?
I can &apos;t wait !
But I &apos;m very pic@@ ky when it comes to choosing a wife .
I hope my children will have a mother like my mother .
She &apos;s a teacher , isn &apos;t she ?
Yeah , she is a high school math teacher .
She loves me very much and very strict .
It was my mother &apos;s blame
that guides the direction of my life .
G@@ lor@@ ia , don &apos;t go . Listen to me .
OK , but you better not explain it to me
that this is an important client and you have a schedule to catch up .
Well , I need a minute to think about it .
I left Joe and went across the ocean ,
which was not to see you at work .
You &apos;re not on vacation at all .
You &apos;re not the first wife to say that .
Then how many wives do you need to take it in ?
This is kit@@ t &apos;s plane bombing &apos;s
shopping invoice for the ingredients of the explosive .
It identified the buyer as Alan Burg@@ ess .
Do you know who he is ?
It &apos;s Fowler &apos;s ali@@ as .
Diane found it when she tracked down his shopping records .
It was purchased a week before the bombing .
Fowler buys explosives and inst@@ alls them on the plane .
What are you looking for ?
S@@ ob@@ er@@ -@@ up Liqu@@ id .
This will clear up han@@ go@@ vers , right ?
My God . We just swept the place out !
Who drank the rum ?
I &apos;m to blame .
How much do you think these will cost ?
Not much , I suppose .
Maybe a few hundred .
The hard drive is burned .
We can only recover one photograph of the farm .
It could be from a job advertisement .
The problem is we don &apos;t know if Brooks sent the advertisement .
He might be looking for a job .
OK , let &apos;s analyze this picture .
See if we can locate the farm .
Maybe it &apos;ll help us identify the killer .
The University of Washington is in the top 10 .
Wait a minute , did you mention the University of Washington ?
Yes .
Is it the one in Seattle , Washington ?
Yes , I know it &apos;s not an ideal school .
What &apos;s not ideal is the location .
But this is the only school that offered me a scholarship .
Can we check Mary Bi@@ gg@@ sby &apos;s car records ?
Is that Mary ?
Probably she is .
I found it !
Mary Bi@@ gg@@ sby drove a blue pickup .
We have registered all the license plates here . We &apos;ll find them .
How long have you played baseball ?
Me ?
Yes .
Never .
Your shirt is great .
This one is water@@ proof .
A single layer of leather made of pol@@ ye@@ th@@ ylene fi@@ bers .
Light and comfortable .
Because it also has cooling properties .
When I wore it , I looked well .
I &apos;m surprised that Ian will be able to run away with Melissa in no time .
Why did he kill himself ?
Maybe he realized that he was going to be caught .
Even with Melissa &apos;s help ,
he can &apos;t hide in his life .
Maybe he &apos;s cor@@ nered .
Whatever Ian does ,
what matters now is that Ellie &apos;s killer is dead .
We &apos;re no longer suspects .
Why didn &apos;t I feel liberated ?
What &apos;s your relationship with Helen Dow@@ ney ?
We are members of the same Wit@@ ches Association .
I must get the names of the other nine .
What association ?
Wit@@ ches Association .
In the Middle A@@ ges it was also called a con@@ vent .
It &apos;s made up of 13 wit@@ ches .
