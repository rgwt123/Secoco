A Republi@@ can strategy to counter the re@@ -@@ election of Obama
Republi@@ can leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Brenn@@ an Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is r@@ arer in the United States than the number of people killed by ligh@@ tn@@ ing .
Indeed , Republi@@ can lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on vot@@ er turn@@ -@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit spirit a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republi@@ can representatives added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 b@@ ills restric@@ ting exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
Furthermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , invali@@ date the right to be register as a vot@@ er on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indi@@ ana first State to impose such such a requirement .
2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States this uph@@ eld the constitu@@ tionality of the Indi@@ ana law .
The Republi@@ can authorities were quick to extend this we practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they spon@@ sored b@@ ills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
It is important to note that , unlike Que@@ bec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
And it often costs over a hundred to obtain the required identity card .
The new restrictions dis@@ proportion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
And that &apos;s not all .
Stu@@ dents , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the and photo ID card issued by their institution .
On the other hand , these States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republi@@ can , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
Pri@@ or to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Ari@@ zona was the first to introduce such a requirement .
Since 2011 , a do@@ zen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the His@@ pan@@ ic vote .
However , it that two out of three His@@ pan@@ ic voters favour the Democratic party .
What more , in 2011 Republi@@ can legislat@@ ors spon@@ sored laws aboli@@ shing the registration of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
These restrictions are not without consequence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , vot@@ er registration campaigns contributed to regi@@ stering around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have to a 17 % drop in registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republi@@ can legislat@@ ors have en@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans , who accoun@@ ted however for only % of voters in the State .
The same applied to His@@ pan@@ ics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
On the other hand , 76 of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic Democratic legislat@@ ors their supporters vigor@@ ously opposed the adoption of laws restric@@ ting vot@@ er registration .
Several b@@ ills were blocked by v@@ eto@@ es of Democratic govern@@ ors .
The United States Att@@ or@@ ney General interven@@ ed to susp@@ end the most controversial laws .
They were able to partially limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
However , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic critics den@@ ounce the parti@@ san character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States .
A 2011 Brenn@@ an Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
It is too early to say with certainty that these changes in the electoral system will have significant imp@@ acts on on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a a a a negative impact on the turn@@ -@@ out .
In this , , , , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Pro@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ?
Indeed , the P@@ SA sometimes shows er@@ ron@@ e@@ ous results with false negative or even false positive results , be which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
En@@ ough to make already reluc@@ tant men hesitate to take screening tests .
Take the test or not ?
We asked two specialists for their opinion opinion opinion opinion .
In studies conducted in the United States , there was a of contamination between control groups , so it is is is difficult to interpre@@ t the data and make firm recommendations .
Another study , this a European , concluded that there was a difference in mor@@ tali@@ ty between patients who were scre@@ ened and those who were not .
This study also showed , with a follo@@ w@@ -@@ up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for met@@ ast@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have are a direct relative who previously had pro@@ state cancer .
Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American men are also more at risk .
The key is to to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
There are aggressive can@@ c@@ ers and others that are in@@ dol@@ ent . . .
The patient really needs to be made to it understand the degree of of risk of his cancer by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating pro@@ state can@@ c@@ ers that are not long@@ -@@ term life threatening , and op@@ ting instead , in such cases , for monitoring of the disease .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been detected not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
Active monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progres@@ ses , they will be offered treatment .
More and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
I recommend taking the test .
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
In collaboration with the Soci@@ é@@ té internationale d &apos;@@ u@@ ro@@ log@@ ie &#91; SI@@ U &#93; , Mo@@ v@@ ember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pro@@ s and cons of the P@@ SA test .

Pre@@ vent@@ ing the disease
Unfortunately , there is no mi@@ racle recip@@ e for preventing cancer .
Despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living hab@@ its remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
is estimated that if everyone ate well and exerc@@ ised enough , 30 % of can@@ c@@ ers could be prevented .
&quot; If no more people smo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , &quot; says Andr@@ é Beau@@ lieu , spo@@ kes@@ man for the Canadian Can@@ cer Society .
On are other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of can@@ c@@ ers are her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary .
Some are also completely un@@ explained .
For the Canadian Canadian Canadian Can@@ cer Society , the fight tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease the number of smo@@ kers .
C@@ ig@@ are@@ ttes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This massi@@ vely damages people &apos;s health .
&quot; Even today , there are 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Que@@ bec &quot; deplo@@ res spo@@ kes@@ person Andr@@ é Beau@@ lieu .
En@@ coura@@ ging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drop@@ s by .

Over@@ weight and o@@ be@@ sity are also con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the on@@ set of the disease , according to the SC@@ C .
They can increase the risks of cancer the breast , col@@ on and rec@@ tum , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ g@@ us , pan@@ cre@@ as and u@@ ter@@ us .
&quot; Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against col@@ on cancer &quot; it is also said .
Di@@ et
The organisation organisation organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat .
In large amounts , it increases the risks of developing colo@@ -@@ rec@@ tal cancer .
Likewise , so do cu@@ red meat products and these should be avoided avoided avoided .
The conservation of meat by smoking , dr@@ ying or cur@@ ing can the formation of car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens .
&quot; They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer &quot; it is explained .
Vit@@ am@@ ins
In recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vit@@ amin supple@@ ments and .
For the being however their research is in@@ conclu@@ sive .
Studies on vit@@ amin E are contradic@@ tory , according to the SC@@ C .
While one study noted decrease in the risk of pro@@ state cancer , another noted noted noted an increase .
Also the effect of vit@@ amin D on cancer is not clear .
In addition , Mr Beau@@ lieu emphasi@@ ses the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
&quot; Taking a screening test doesn &apos;t give you cancer . &quot;
The Hig@@ gs bo@@ son revealed
The announcement of the prob@@ able discovery the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son created quite a sti@@ r last summer , and with good reason .
Indeed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Uni@@ verse , no less .
Also it is the last partic@@ le whose existence is is is predic@@ ted by the Standard Model - our best or &quot; less worse &quot; explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed emp@@ i@@ ri@@ cally .
But for physi@@ ci@@ sts , it it is still not completely sure that it really is Hig@@ gs .
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is new authentic partic@@ le , and greatly res@@ embles the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son predic@@ ted by the Standard Model .
In addition , new data un@@ vei@@ led this week at a large physi@@ cs Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
But let &apos;s sup@@ pose that it really is the Hig@@ gs , since since the chances of being mistak@@ en seem sli@@ m , and see what it is .
In our world , there is fat@@ ally un@@ avoid@@ able law which states that two things cannot meet meet meet meet at the same place at the same time .
There &apos;s &apos;s no to break this rule - and don &apos;t try hard , you the &apos;ll go mad .
However , even though partic@@ le physi@@ cs is a very world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind kind : the Pau@@ li exclusion principle , which states that two partic@@ les cannot cannot cannot cannot occup@@ y the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot; qu@@ ant@@ um state &quot; - this &quot; state &quot; consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics .
Based on this , physi@@ ci@@ sts classi@@ fy partic@@ les into two categories .
In one corner we have good good good citizens called fer@@ mi@@ ons , who on wis@@ ely o@@ bey the Pau@@ li principle .
While l@@ ur@@ king in the other are the bo@@ sons , a n@@ asty band of an@@ arch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
These bo@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Ber@@ kel@@ ey Lab@@ s Par@@ ticle Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mes@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and &quot; force partic@@ les &quot; by which the great forces of of of of nature are prop@@ ag@@ ated and to which the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son may be somehow related .
These a bo@@ sons it must be stressed here , are not all such exotic bugs as you might think .
In fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extra@@ ordin@@ arily ban@@ al bo@@ son : phot@@ on , or the light partic@@ le &quot; which is the &quot; mess@@ enger &quot; of the electro@@ magnetic force .
When , in fact , a partic@@ le having an electric charge acceler@@ ates or changes direction , this &quot; distur@@ bs &quot; the electro@@ magnetic field in this specific place , rather like a p@@ eb@@ ble thrown in a p@@ ond .
This &quot; distur@@ b@@ ance &quot; produces an electro@@ magnetic wave ( of light , infra@@ red , ultra@@ viol@@ et etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a phot@@ on - and thus one of the &quot; force carrier &quot; bo@@ sons .
More stable field
The same applies to the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the Hig@@ gs field , which must be &quot; distur@@ bed &quot; for the bo@@ son to appear .
Now , this Hig@@ gs field is much , much more stable than the electro@@ magnetic field ; to exc@@ ite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen p@@ ond which would The need a very large large large large rock to w@@ rin@@ k@@ le the surface .
Which is why a huge partic@@ le acceler@@ ator like the one at C@@ ER@@ N - the Large H@@ ad@@ ron Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ km circum@@ ference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
The an@@ alog@@ y with the electro@@ magnetic is again useful for expla@@ ining the between the Hig@@ gs and mass .
In fact not all partic@@ les , or all materials , inter@@ act with the electro@@ magnetic field .
Some , as ma@@ gn@@ ets , do so , but others don &apos;t - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick a fridge .
And likewise , not all partic@@ les inter@@ act with the Hig@@ gs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the phot@@ on ) do not .
Now , what is it that all this research &quot; can bring &quot; ? asks Ms P@@ lam@@ on@@ don .
For science , it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model ( SM ) , and also allows physi@@ cians to examine any discre@@ pan@@ cies between the observations and predic@@ tions of the the the SM .
A number of people , moreover , fer@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found , because the sligh@@ test difference could open a door to a &quot; new physi@@ cs &quot; and plug certain holes in the Model .
This , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation grav@@ ity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Uni@@ verse ( re@@ -@@ o@@ ops ! ) .
But to date no such discre@@ pan@@ cies have been found at C@@ ER@@ N .
Re@@ percussions
The repercussions of this research on the daily life the man in the street are more difficult to predic@@ t , but it would be wrong to assume that there won &apos;t be any .
Rem@@ ember : in the very early 6@@ 0s , the pione@@ ers of the laser at B@@ ell Labor@@ atories did not suspect the revolution that would be trig@@ ger@@ ed by their work .
They had an in@@ kl@@ ing of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest .
In fact , the late Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle - a physi@@ c@@ ist who worked at B@@ ell Lab@@ s , where the the the laser was inv@@ ented in 1960 , and who himself developed the first continuous laser ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a &quot; la@@ b g@@ ad@@ get . &quot;
Just imagine ...
And then , applications can also come from all the instru@@ mentation that sur@@ rounds research .
For example , the same Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle developed a small light sensor in 1969 , during his work in op@@ tics .
This sensor , although this was not at all the original intention , , now serves as an &quot; eye &quot; to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physi@@ cs prize in 2009 .
This does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ HC will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
Pal@@ li@@ ative care - this The we way to die ... &#124; Le Dev@@ o@@ ir
With its D@@ ying with D@@ ign@@ ity Commission , Que@@ bec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life .
The debate is due to resu@@ me shortly as a bill is being prepared .
However , , in this vital area , much remains to be done .
Le Dev@@ o@@ ir attempted to look more closely .
Just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Mont@@ é@@ ré@@ g@@ ie apartment .
The fest@@ ering pro@@ state cancer had allowed him a tw@@ o@@ -@@ year resp@@ ite .
&quot; They gave me five years to live , I &apos;ve made it to seven , &quot; he says with mixed emotions , lying in his bed at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care in Bel@@ o@@ eil , where he arrived the previous day .
&quot; But it &apos;s still a shock , you can be prepared for it &quot; he adds .
The disease doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone , and even eating alone .
Sit@@ ting in front of an appe@@ ti@@ sing lunch , he con@@ s@@ ents to being helped helped helped to eat , re@@ signed .
Cou@@ ra@@ geous , he even man@@ ages to s@@ mile , talks to the stran@@ gers bu@@ st@@ ling around him , bringing him his medic@@ ation , offering him a bath .
The courage of ordinary death .
&quot; What I want most to be cu@@ red of my di@@ ar@@ r@@ ho@@ ea , it &apos;s humili@@ ating &quot; he confi@@ ded .
A few hours later , the team found a a cure for this illness .
&quot; During our our our our lives , we learn that a man pis@@ ses standing up , &quot; says Pierre Bro@@ de@@ ur , psych@@ ologist at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home .
Re@@ gres@@ sing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humili@@ ation .
&quot; It depends on the person &apos;s ability &quot; of to accept the reg@@ ression , , he says .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in pal@@ li@@ ative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such reg@@ ression .
Pati@@ ents at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is pal@@ li@@ ative care home all suffer from cancer .
They have a maximum life life life life expec@@ tan@@ cy of three months .
At this stage , the team of doctors and nur@@ ses surrounding them no longer provides so@@ -@@ called &quot; cu@@ rative &quot; care .
For Mrs A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die &quot; conscious and suff@@ oc@@ ating . &quot;
But the disease has made discover my children .
&quot; I have fine &quot; .
I don &apos;t wish for anything more in life &quot; she says , before accepting having a m@@ ask put on on to help her brea@@ the .
She looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
At Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is , a group of volunte@@ ers provides bo@@ di@@ ly care and help with feeding .
This is pal@@ li@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be .
To make death more comfortable .
Que@@ bec , there are pal@@ li@@ ative care beds for 1@@ 1,@@ 700 inhabitants .
This is very few when we know that we will all die die one day
Here , life life life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home .
Whether at a physical comfort , emotional or spiritual level .
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brand@@ y or Pep@@ si , whatever is their ti@@ pp@@ le . .
Di@@ abe@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar .
And death is part of everyday life .
Yesterday evening , a beer was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
This morning , it is his son who will finish the beer the feet of the dec@@ e@@ ased .
&quot; We help rel@@ atives as much as patients &quot; says says says says N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Sav@@ ard , Director of Care .
At the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home , day follows another but no two are alike .
Along with a 9@@ 3@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old man who is sav@@ ouring his last with his family , sitting firmly wed@@ ged in his pil@@ lows while to@@ asts are dr@@ unk his honour , a 36@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ young man is dying tra@@ gi@@ cally , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
&quot; For six months , there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients than 45 years old &quot; says a concerned Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel .
53 % of patients admitted to the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home come from their is homes , 47 % from hospital .
L@@ ack of access to pal@@ li@@ ative care
It is said that 77 % of Canadi@@ ans simply have no access to pal@@ li@@ ative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home
And a number of organisations , such as the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ bo@@ is home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Gre@@ ater , speciali@@ se more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
It is precisely large gap in Que@@ bec health care which has made a number of pal@@ li@@ ative care physi@@ cians fear the of a law on eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia and assi@@ sted suici@@ de .
Since October , a manifest@@ o , signed by pal@@ li@@ ative care l@@ umin@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four Mount and Dr Bern@@ ard La@@ poin@@ te , has been circul@@ ating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
According Dr Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the Que@@ bec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality pal@@ li@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia .
Recently , she she she she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
I &apos;m afraid that patients ask to because they don &apos;t receive receive receive receive adequate care .
And at the same time , some on@@ c@@ ologists work rel@@ ent@@ lessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst progno@@ ses .
H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ ne Richard &apos;s survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling chem@@ o@@ therapy .
When announced to my on@@ c@@ ologist that I was st@@ opping the treatment , she told me she regre@@ t@@ ted that I had given up fighting , she said .
However , she had told me I was finished !
all@@ -@@ powerful care
Dr Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care@@ -@@ gi@@ vers for not having acc@@ eded to their request after they have been relie@@ ved of their pain by a pal@@ li@@ ative care team .
But it must be said that pal@@ li@@ ative care is not absolutely all@@ -@@ powerful in in in the treatment of pain .
According that El@@ sie Mon@@ ere@@ au , Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Director with the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Society in Gre@@ ater Montreal , patients are resistant resistant resistant resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the very end of life , physi@@ cians then often resort to pal@@ li@@ ative sed@@ ation , which is equivalent to putting the patient patient patient patient to sleep until the time of death , either spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally or permanently .
We can no longer pre@@ tend not to understand this part of their suffering .
Incre@@ as@@ ingly , an un@@ relie@@ ved patient will have the option of having such pal@@ li@@ ative sed@@ ation .
Pati@@ ents who are not relie@@ ved always say the same thing : &quot; I want to die . &quot;
But this does not necessarily &quot; I want you to eu@@ than@@ ise me , , &quot; it means &quot; I want to be relie@@ ved . &quot;

Wi@@ des@@ pread real estate scand@@ als in Que@@ bec
Day after day highway officials , building contrac@@ tors , political party fund@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ers and Italian ma@@ fia specialists tell what they know of a form@@ id@@ able &quot; system , &quot; combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade uni@@ on@@ ists and organised crime .
An &quot; industry &quot; which has cost Que@@ bec taxpayers de@@ arly , especially in the 1990s and 200@@ 0s .
&quot; It is curi@@ ous how the system is cru@@ mb@@ ling since we took dra@@ stic measures &quot; says Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au ir@@ on@@ ically , a Que@@ bec politi@@ cian and former Montreal Chief of Police .
It was through him that the broke in 2011 in an in@@ -@@ depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Que@@ bec , to which the liberal Prime Minister at at at at the time , Jean Cha@@ rest , had con@@ s@@ ented only reluc@@ t@@ antly .
The &quot; Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report &quot; established a direct link between industry , under@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ table financing of parties and bri@@ ber@@ y of officials .
&quot; Since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone re@@ porte@@ dly saved billion dollars and on contracts , &quot; with certain people cur@@ bing their inst@@ inc@@ ts to get a share !
The Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission &quot; has already brought down two may@@ ors &quot; he adds , hoping that it will succeed in &quot; reve@@ aling the schemes behind the individuals . &quot;
A permanent anti@@ -@@ corruption unit , , , , created in 2011
The Per@@ man@@ ent Anti@@ -@@ Cor@@ ruption Unit , created in 2011 , is also coupled with its army of government an@@ al@@ yst@@ s , investig@@ ators , and audi@@ tors .
Plus &quot; Mar@@ teau squ@@ ad &quot; poli@@ c@@ emen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal &quot; &quot; se@@ wer car@@ tel &quot; to soft ped@@ al on the inflation of contracts ...
In recent weeks , it has conducted a series of sear@@ ches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Frank Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ cot@@ te , Mayor of a sub@@ urban town .
Next on the is apparently Gil@@ les V@@ ail@@ lan@@ court , who has just re@@ signed from his post as Mayor of Lav@@ al , third largest city in Que@@ bec .
He is suspec@@ ted of po@@ ck@@ eting repeated bri@@ bes in exchange for public contracts .
O@@ thers formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Acc@@ ur@@ so and Lin@@ o Z@@ ambi@@ to .
The latter caused a sen@@ sation by expla@@ ining the mechan@@ ics of the and public system &quot; to the commission .
He himself paid 3 of the value of the contracts obtained with in Montreal to an intermedi@@ ary linked to the ma@@ fia who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , Mayor G@@ ér@@ ald Tre@@ mb@@ lay &apos;s party .
Mr Z@@ ambi@@ to has handed money money money out freely in the 200@@ 0s , giving over 8@@ 8@@ ,000 Canadian dollars roughly 68@@ ,000 euros ) to provin@@ cial parties , especially the Liberals then in power .
He also admitted organised an illegal fund@@ ra@@ iser for former Liberal Dep@@ ut@@ y@@ -@@ Prime Minister , N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au .
Se@@ wer contracts with infl@@ ated costs
Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; ran smooth@@ ly .
Gil@@ les Sur@@ pren@@ ant , former public works engine@@ er , described it in detail in front it of the commission in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , inv@@ it@@ ations to trips , golf tour@@ naments , restaurants , ho@@ ckey matches and bri@@ bes tot@@ alling 7@@ 36@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ wer contracts of which he infl@@ ated the costs .
Other highway officials admitted having their pal@@ ms gre@@ ased by infl@@ ating invo@@ ices by 30 to 40 % , and by false add@@ -@@ ons .
Then an organis@@ er of the &apos;s party , Martin Dum@@ ont , accused Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coff@@ ers with dirty money .
Following these re@@ vel@@ ations , Mr Tre@@ mb@@ lay re@@ signed in early in November , pl@@ ung@@ ing Montreal into a major crisis .
Ch@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ le@@ au was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm .
Mayor of the bor@@ ough of Ri@@ vi@@ è@@ re@@ -@@ des@@ -@@ Pra@@ i@@ ries , it to the East of the island , she pro@@ tested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and res@@ old for ... 1.@@ 6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
70 % dirty money in election campaigns
On investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she &quot; is following a thread in order to find out how the system - in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gan@@ gr@@ ene and catch the cul@@ pri@@ ts . &quot;
The process , she says , is is &quot; painful but positive . &quot;
The wo@@ und is being clean@@ ed , but Montreal would need its own investig@@ ative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these question@@ able practices .
How to clean house .
Prop@@ erly .
Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that &quot; officials st@@ ole hundreds of millions of dollars , &quot; but he is especially concerned about the role of elected people aware of the scheme , &quot; when they were not up to their nec@@ ks in the sc@@ am !

&quot; PS@@ G is not FC Barcelona ! &quot;
This season , you have taken on a new stat@@ ure PS@@ G .
How do you explain this progres@@ sion ?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also of by the new dimension of PS@@ G .
Some great players have arrived .
Every day I &apos;m making progress alongside them .
The technical staff has also brought me a lot .
Day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
And , in a match , it &apos;s easier .
Everything moves very fast in football .
But I don &apos;t get worked up . and
From my de@@ but the C@@ la@@ i@@ ref@@ on@@ taine IN@@ F pre@@ -@@ training centre to my transfer to Sa@@ int@@ -@@ E@@ tien@@ ne , I &apos;ve always moved step by step .
So you benefit from the brought in by Carlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti ...
This summer &apos;s recru@@ its are used to playing matches at a high .
They also know that every training session is crucial .
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
On the other hand , Carlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti gives me a lot as regards position .
He &apos;s supported by de@@ pu@@ ties like Claude Mak@@ el@@ ele , who played in the same position as .
Is An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti the man for the job ?
Defin@@ itely .
An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti inspi@@ res respect among all to the experts .
Today he has no equal in Lig@@ ue 1 , , , , and he &apos;s one the best co@@ aches in Europe .
He has m@@ asses of experience and has won are many titles with top clubs .
He &apos;s worked with great players .
I think he will bring more titles to Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of inj@@ uries .
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
What importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PS@@ G ?
In Lig@@ ue 1 , Lyon over@@ took us at the top .
But we &apos;re waiting on the si@@ delines .
One of our main goals is the Champ@@ ions League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
What is the club &apos;s goal in this competition ?
We &apos;ll try to go as far as possible .
From now on , anything can happen .
But we &apos;ll have something to say against some very good European teams teams teams .
First of all , we want to finish finish finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
Can PS@@ G become a top European club in the short term ?
It already has the budget ...
To become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over over over time .
Today , this isn &apos;t the the the the case .
Finan@@ cially , PS@@ G has the means to make it happen .
In Lig@@ ue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ?
Defin@@ itely , it would be a major dis@@ appointment .
This year , we &apos;re really committed to winning the champ@@ ionship .
We weren &apos;t far away last season .
In May , there was dis@@ appointment because we were good enough to . finish first .
It was a terri@@ fic season season .
We finished with 79 points .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , 79 points is good enough to be top ...
But another team , Mont@@ p@@ elli@@ er , had an even more fantastic fantastic season .
I think this is the year .
Even if big teams like Mar@@ sei@@ lle , Lyon and Bor@@ de@@ aux are competing for the title , I think we have the to win .
Do you think the media expect too much of PS@@ G ?
It &apos;s normal them to , expect a lot from us given what &apos;s been invested and the the the players players we have have have have .
We totally accept it .
After we won 4@@ -@@ 0 at against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that that that &apos;s definitely a bit fru@@ str@@ ating .
You what more people expect .
You &apos;re never going to win 4@@ -@@ 0 every weekend .
We &apos;re not FC Barcelona !
We &apos;re trying to implement a game project .
It takes time to build a team .
The Champ@@ ions League proved we could hold our own .
Look at Manchester City who , for two seas@@ ons , have failed to quali@@ fy for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
Based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship .
Lyon and Mar@@ sei@@ lle , were no good last season , were &quot; boo@@ sted &quot; by the new PS@@ G .
This shows that Lig@@ ue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be able to s@@ mile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
PS@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic .
So much so that people say there is a &quot; Z@@ lat@@ an dependence . &quot; &quot;
This means I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic is very successful and sco@@ res a lot of .
That &apos;s why he came , and he &apos;s pro@@ ving he &apos;s the star of Lig@@ ue 1 .
He &apos;s demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
Within the group , we respect the man and the player .
And also he respects the men he has around around him .
What he has done is truly .
It pus@@ hes others to raise their level of play .
Th@@ i@@ ago Sil@@ va , who is one of the as best defen@@ ders in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
A dis@@ appointment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
Unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I saw saw some things there and came out stronger .
Today , I playing well in selection matches .
Which what I &apos;ve we been hoping for since my b@@ ap@@ tism with the Blu@@ es .
I &apos;ve learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now o@@ we it to myself to have exempl@@ ary behaviour .
What do think about Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ champ@@ s &apos;s first few months in of the Blu@@ es ?
He has the results he wanted .
We &apos;re well in the World quali@@ fying group .
The coach is tough , close to to to to the players , and inspi@@ res them to win .
Like Lau@@ rent Blan@@ c was .
But don &apos;t want to make any compar@@ isons .
Blan@@ c had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ champ@@ s will take the Blu@@ es to .
Di@@ d the good draw ( 1@@ -@@ 1 ) s@@ nat@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
That match gave us us confidence .
Every@@ body for everybody .
Before that shock in Spain , I &apos;d never experienced such a match in my my my my career .
With Bit@@ coin , pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions processing fees among the parties involved .
In addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is pal@@ p@@ able : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopoli@@ es , leads to financial crises .
In fact , Bit@@ coin , inv@@ ented by Sat@@ o@@ sh@@ i N@@ ak@@ am@@ o@@ to ( a p@@ seu@@ don@@ y@@ m ) , is both a virtual currency ( but con@@ verti@@ ble into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange protocol like Bit@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows pe@@ er@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ pe@@ er file file file file exchange .
Around 200@@ ,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15@@ ,000 computers on the network .
Close to a thousand web sites accept on bit@@ coins as don@@ ations or means of payment .
The bit@@ coin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later later later later , returning today to around a do@@ zen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ ts@@ .com site ) .
Nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products .
However , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report report on virtual currencies published in October .
It describes bit@@ coin as &quot; the most successful virtual currency , &quot; &quot; in competition with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to conventional currencies . &quot;
Bit@@ coin diff@@ ers from other types of of of of virtual currency such such as as as as &apos; credits &apos; used to progress in in a video game which you win by playing is or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system .
But , on each occasion , a central authority controls and hand@@ les the exchanges .
With With With Bit@@ coin , all no@@ des in the network are both cu@@ sto@@ di@@ ans of the book of accounts , audi@@ tors , currency issu@@ ers , and bu@@ yers and and and s@@ ellers .
How does the network operate ?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e@@ -@@ mail .
Exc@@ ept that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anony@@ m@@ ity .
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electron@@ ically by a du@@ al@@ -@@ key encryption system .
So the network can verify the authentic@@ ity of the transaction .
Using the contents of the file , it is also to ensure that the ex@@ changed bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book .
It passes through the resolution of of of of a mathemati@@ cal challenge issued to the computers , and winner , a kind of interim central ban@@ ker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line . a
This is a file h@@ ash@@ ing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital im@@ print .
Compu@@ ters &quot; take &quot; the new transaction and add a number number to it , then &quot; h@@ ash &quot; it all up .
The goal being to find the number that gives a special im@@ print ( lots that of zer@@ os at the beginning ) . . .
Once this has been , the other no@@ des can easily check that it is the right one one one one .
The transaction is then inde@@ struc@@ ti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the im@@ print .
If a user wanted to def@@ rau@@ d by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the would remain an orph@@ an because the two have different im@@ prints .
The computer that resol@@ ves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ coins .
To inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
The number of bit@@ coins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 , but they are divi@@ sible down to the hundred milli@@ on@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
The difficulty of the challenge is raised with each increase in comp@@ uting power .
The life of the network has had its ups and down@@ s .
Websites providing services for Bit@@ coin have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposits st@@ olen .
&quot; The lo@@ op@@ hole used is not the protocol itself &quot; says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at re@@ assur@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ mium , a real currency payment company that uses the Bit@@ coin network .
The ECB also the possibilities of money la@@ undering using this anonymous .
But cash has this weakness .
Major players like Wiki@@ pedia don@@ ations of this nature .
O@@ thers , such as the WordPress blog platform , accept them .
Recently , Ad@@ i Sh@@ am@@ ir and Dor@@ it R@@ on , from the Wei@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel , analy@@ sed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not circul@@ ate .
In November , &quot; huge s@@ ell@@ -@@ off@@ s &quot; were launched .
&quot; Thir@@ ty thousand dollars were ex@@ changed &quot; welcomes J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ ab@@ ul , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of of of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
His system , Pay@@ t@@ unia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a cont@@ ac@@ tless payment by mobile , but it uses Bit@@ coin to a vali@@ date transactions , which are thus cheaper .
Also the user man@@ ages his identity and can therefore be anonymous .
The system is easy to implement by merchan@@ ts , who not need to install new termin@@ als or software .
They just need to provide an address that a phone can &quot; phot@@ ograph and recognise &quot; says Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , who confirms he has thousands of users .
There is a as general movement to re@@ app@@ raise hierarch@@ ical systems for more horizontal systems .
&quot; It will take time for Bit@@ coin to become firmly established , but could be a turning point , &quot; he predic@@ ts .
The ECB , in its report , says it will re@@ assess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency &apos;s success .
We got got got got out of Afghanistan .
What now ?
French troops have left their area of to responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kap@@ isa and Su@@ rob@@ i ) .
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 .
It is time for the Afghan to resu@@ me possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
It is mainly Afghan pe@@ as@@ ants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists . . . .
And the ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wo@@ unded , the ma@@ im@@ ed .
The Taliban is composed of foreign extrem@@ ists , former leaders in in in in refu@@ ge in Pakistan , but often pe@@ as@@ ants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , , like in the time of the Sovi@@ ets .
They want to defend their traditions both ancient and arch@@ a@@ ic , even though they have been joined by Ji@@ ha@@ di@@ sts , Pakist@@ an@@ is , Ara@@ bs , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , Ta@@ ji@@ ks .
Toler@@ ated , sometimes assi@@ sted , by local insur@@ g@@ ents , the latter will no longer be so when West@@ ern@@ ers become more scar@@ ce .
The departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ ra@@ b base , which I observed from the top of hills of al@@ mond plan@@ ted with French funding , was in carried out in an or@@ derly fashion .
Con@@ vo@@ ys of tru@@ cks and arm@@ oured vehicles reached Kab@@ ul without being attacked , over@@ flo@@ wn by helicop@@ ters .
There will be no wave of the Taliban a in Kab@@ ul by the end of 2014 .
Cir@@ cum@@ stances have changed since their ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble advance between 1994 and 1996 .
At that time Kab@@ ul was empty , the country being tor@@ n apart by the stru@@ gg@@ les between different fac@@ tions .
Their ta@@ ke@@ over of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liber@@ ation a return to safety .
Afghan@@ is paid the price of the ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ anti@@ sm of these pe@@ as@@ ants by the organisation of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a@@ eda , but their situation has not improved today .
For@@ mer Mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ din , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are al@@ lied in the desire to keep women in an in@@ fer@@ ior position .
The main anti@@ -@@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 .
They became profit@@ e@@ ers , sei@@ zing government land to res@@ ell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , , , benef@@ iting from huge American outs@@ ourcing contracts .
They have become dis@@ credited ; what is more , most them did not fight themselves .
The people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of th@@ iev@@ es .
Many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American lar@@ ges@@ se leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
The young people are tired of war and its ide@@ ologies .
They have rub@@ bed shoul@@ ders with the modern world during their ex@@ ile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
Rou@@ ghly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kab@@ ul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
In towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike .
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to to the ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ anti@@ sm of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
All of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , , , with its Turkish so@@ ap oper@@ as that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
The army is now present .
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ?
For@@ mer comm@@ anders of the anti@@ -@@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restor@@ ing provin@@ cial mili@@ ti@@ as , which will escape the central power .
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identi@@ ties , should be able to benefit from a certain decentrali@@ sation , in the image of the Western nations but the United States wanted to turn it into a centrali@@ sed State , with strong presidential power , aboli@@ shing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Kar@@ z@@ ai does not want any any foreign a controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 .
But , since the 50@@ s and already well before , country has been dependent on foreign aid .
No industries have been re@@ -@@ established , no dam@@ s are in good condition , no The major ir@@ rig@@ ation systems have been repa@@ ired .
Everything is imported ; nothing nothing nothing nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
The Pri@@ ority is left to private initiative .
In a country ru@@ ined by thirty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary .
The rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth .
This only to the feeling that the West@@ ern@@ ers were were only there to sei@@ ze it .
With no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining .
The Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak copper mine , leaving international archae@@ ologists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Buddh@@ ist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely , to restore normal relations .
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls &apos; high school , boys &apos; high school , French Department at the University French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support the archae@@ ological Delegation .
Since 2009 , to try to &quot; win hearts and minds &quot; , and achieve the impossible task of re@@ conc@@ iling aid and offensive actions , a &quot; ci@@ vil@@ -@@ military actions &quot; service from the Ministry of defence ( C@@ im@@ ic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NG@@ O , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in doz@@ ens of mountain villages .
These These These These projects , involving large numbers of local labour , have helped to contain the insur@@ gency : ir@@ rig@@ ation , well@@ s , drinking water , re@@ fore@@ station fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able . .
What will we leave as a sou@@ ven@@ ir , after two billion euros of military spending ?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2@@ ,000 metres above sea level .
The E@@ mb@@ assy has received doz@@ ens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kap@@ isa province .
To be in a position to free themselves from the u@@ pris@@ ing led by foreign groups which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be be be be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new gam@@ ble for President Moh@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
Taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that that that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final final final final text the following day .
Just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish The its work .
For two years Egypt has reli@@ ed on a provi@@ sional text text text text , amended several times and this has weak@@ ened institutional stability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ gli@@ os .
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country .
According to his opponents , the President is per@@ sever@@ ing in his &quot; auto@@ cratic deli@@ ri@@ um , continuing to &quot; go back on his word &quot; and &apos; tra@@ mp@@ le the law . &quot;
His supporters affir@@ m that this is the quick@@ est way to put end to the institutional and political crisis , by spe@@ eding up the transition on process .
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
A very short period , which forces the Bro@@ thers to abandon their plan to to explain the text , article by article , to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
For the President , it is also a way achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute ra@@ ges throughout the country .
Moh@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si seems convinced that Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will vote favou@@ ra@@ bly , as he stated in an the American weekly .
Partic@@ ularly since a ha@@ sty vote sm@@ acks of an ultim@@ atum to the Egyptian : &quot; Ei@@ ther you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , &quot; these powers sup@@ posedly exp@@ iring following adoption of the Constitution .
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constitu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Islam@@ ist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
Most of the liber@@ als were missing missing missing missing .
In mid@@ -@@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had sl@@ amm@@ ed the door , feeling they had failed to asser@@ t their views .
Represent@@ atives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done likewise .
In order it to obtain obtain a qu@@ or@@ um , 11 members , altern@@ ates , were has@@ ti@@ ly added yesterday morning .
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
Not surpris@@ ingly , the articles were for the part voted unanimously .
Comm@@ ent@@ ators were am@@ used that one of the only di@@ versions of the day was expressed with to ... the hour of pra@@ yer , some Committee members feeling that the Constitu@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong .
The text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 23@@ 4 articles .
The main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , stipul@@ ating that &quot; principles of sh@@ aria are the main source of law . &quot;
The Sal@@ af@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of of of of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace &quot; the principles &quot; by &quot; the rules &quot; which would have allowed stricter application .
For the Islam@@ ists , the fact that this article not amended is a of their good@@ will and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society .
&quot; Hypo@@ cris@@ y &quot; respond the liber@@ als , who see only a communication communication communication coup .
Because in their opinion Islam@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other be articles .
They refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al@@ -@@ Az@@ h@@ ar University an advisory role , with particular reference to veri@@ fying the con@@ formity of the laws with sh@@ aria .
According to Egypt specialist S@@ oph@@ ie P@@ omm@@ ier , this is worrying because &quot; the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
This suggests the beginn@@ ings of a the@@ o@@ cracy . &quot;
The liber@@ als &apos; fears are also fu@@ elled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much much much less moderate than The current one .
&quot; For the time being , there is no concrete religious implic@@ ation .
With this Constitution , things remain under civil rule .
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law schol@@ ars but academ@@ ics , some some trained the French system &quot; quali@@ fies Ale@@ xis Bl@@ ou@@ et , who is writing a thesis I on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
But he acknowled@@ ges that &quot; there may be some ambigu@@ ity regarding article 220 , because the terms used bor@@ row from the religious voc@@ abul@@ ary .
Re@@ ference is in particular to &quot; fi@@ q@@ h &quot; &#91; Islamic juris@@ pru@@ dence , Editor Editor &apos;s note &#93; .
And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil civil judges are The competent to pron@@ ounce on it . &quot;
Beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Bro@@ thers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what what they were under the former regime .
Another issue : the powers con@@ ferred on the army .
In accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but but but but to a National Defence Council .
will trials of civilians will be banned in military tri@@ bun@@ als , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
Who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repres@@ sive
The off@@ ence of blas@@ ph@@ em@@ y is maintained and insul@@ ts are now prohibited , which could serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the .
In addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights Heb@@ a Mor@@ a@@ ye@@ f , from Human Rights Watch .
In her opinion , the only positive point is the prohi@@ bition of torture in article 36 .
The word was not included in the previous Constitution .
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
Sup@@ por@@ ters of the Head of State will mar@@ ch on Saturday .
In Israel , hol@@ y await Ukrainian tourists , the omp@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
The Holy Land combines the sp@@ l@@ end@@ our of bi@@ b@@ lical tru@@ ths , modern comfort and pri@@ me@@ val nature .
A@@ i@@ F &#91; Argum@@ ent@@ i i Fak@@ ti &#93; newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
Let &apos;s wor@@ ship the hol@@ y places
It is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed .
It is that all who enter this b@@ ap@@ tism &quot; bath &quot; are bl@@ essed by God .
Galile@@ e is the place where Jesus performed his magic : turned into wine at a wedding , wal@@ ked on water , cal@@ med a storm , and the nets .
is also where Jesus came before his his his dis@@ ciples and after res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion .
But the biggest number of hol@@ y places is in Jerusalem .
Be@@ lie@@ vers walk through the Way of Grie@@ f or Via Dol@@ or@@ o@@ sa .
It starts by the Ant@@ onia Fort@@ ress - Pra@@ et@@ orium - where the jud@@ gement took place , and brings us the streets of the the the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sep@@ ul@@ ch@@ re on Gol@@ go@@ tha - the place of the cru@@ ci@@ fi@@ x@@ ion , St@@ one of Un@@ ction and the place of Jesus &apos; bu@@ rial .
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian omp@@ hal@@ os , which symboli@@ zes the sal@@ vation of mankind .
The Holy Cross Mon@@ astery in Jerusalem is er@@ ected at the site that , according to Christian le@@ gend , yiel@@ ded the tree used to make make make the cross for Jesus &apos; cru@@ ci@@ fi@@ x@@ ion .
Jerusalem has the most hol@@ y places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ailing Wall , which remained from a temple destroyed by the Rom@@ ans in 70 AD .
According to tradition , people of different fai@@ ths notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
Travel along a vertical
Ru@@ ins the Mass@@ ada Fort@@ ress remain from and a secret refu@@ ge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family .
They are located on cli@@ ffs in the mountains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m and above sea level .
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing .
O@@ thers are delivered to this historical mountain@@ top by a cab@@ le@@ way .
In the north of the country at an elev@@ ation of 16@@ 00@@ -@@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which f@@ ills up with tourists in winter months .
A shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain .
The total length of ski ski ski p@@ ist@@ es is 45 km .
According to an ancient le@@ gend , p@@ agan go@@ ds used to live on mountain .
Visit unique museums
This country has about 300 museums .
You won &apos;t be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit .
Among them - Museum Museum Museum of Israel , located close to Kn@@ es@@ set ( Parliament ) .
It has ancient Q@@ um@@ ran man@@ us@@ cri@@ pts De@@ ad Sea sc@@ roll@@ s found in in in in the c@@ aves of the Ju@@ de@@ an desert , along with about 500@@ ,000 archae@@ ological and an@@ thropo@@ logical ar@@ te@@ facts .
The Museum of Art in Tel@@ -@@ Avi@@ v is also interesting .
Its exhi@@ bits include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ ar@@ ro , Ren@@ o@@ ir , Sis@@ ley , Ce@@ z@@ anne , M@@ ati@@ sse , Modi@@ gli@@ ani , Cha@@ g@@ all , Pic@@ asso .
In Ak@@ ko , you can visit the bath museum Al@@ -@@ B@@ ash@@ a , which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with of of of visitors and bath atten@@ dan@@ ts of the time .
In Ca@@ es@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private R@@ all@@ i Museum , where you can enjoy the sculp@@ tures of Dal@@ i and Ro@@ din .
There are no tour guides or gift shops .
En@@ try is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed .
The fifth one is the Holocaust Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in Tel@@ -@@ Avi@@ v , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
The most tragic section is the children &apos;s mem@@ orial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas cham@@ bers .
You go in and find yourself in complete dark@@ ness .
Stars are gli@@ m@@ mer@@ ing ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they .
Ukraine is mentioned there too .

Only the the the the &quot; high and mi@@ ghty &quot; make it to Moscow : migrants save save money for language
While de@@ pu@@ ties and human rights activists argue about purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has sc@@ am artists who sell fa@@ ke certificates .
Every year million m@@ igrant workers come in to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
Mo@@ stly these are citizens of Central Asia : U@@ z@@ bekistan , Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan and Turk@@ men@@ istan .
Their only goal is to earn money to support families families families back home .
A new law came into effect on December 1 , which obli@@ ges every m@@ igrant worker on to pass a Russian language .
For For For For the moment , this law applies to those who intend to work in services , , , , housing and utility services , household services , and retail . . .
But with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non@@ -@@ residents .
In addition to language , Russian history and basi@@ cs of the legal system will be tested .
Language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive receive receive receive and to extend the work permit permit .
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where . Russian is a state language .
People who who who received education certificates and diplom@@ as before the fall of the US@@ SR in 1991 are also exemp@@ t under the law .
Pur@@ pose , do@@ omed , and the protection of rights
Seven testing points will be under the au@@ sp@@ ices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Language , Pe@@ oples &apos; Fri@@ end@@ ship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( SP@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions .
M@@ igrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such have been opened .
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Dum@@ a members and the Federal Migration Services .
But human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and and and and for the non@@ -@@ residents ?
First of of of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this this this this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour sla@@ very .
speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia , Vi@@ ktor Seb@@ el@@ e@@ v .
protection should begin before their departure .
Only the system of organized selection will will will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
M@@ igrants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certificate start have have have have problems .
If a m@@ igrant does not understand the , says Seb@@ el@@ e@@ v with certainty , he is do@@ omed to come across un@@ con@@ scienti@@ ous people , who , pre@@ ten@@ ding to help , will force upon him a &quot; ticket &quot; to terrible , cra@@ mp@@ ed bar@@ ra@@ cks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12@@ -@@ 14 hours a day .
We receive many complaints from our migrants .
&quot; They are promised one thing of at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their pas@@ sports are taken , they are not paid . what they were promised , &quot; confirms confirms the Head of of the M@@ igrant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan To@@ li@@ b Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v .
Not be an@@ gr@@ y , bo@@ ss !
Nonetheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
Naturally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Tur@@ ks , , , , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , and Ta@@ ji@@ ks can afford even a a a a basic education .
Their families don &apos;t even have food to feed their children , not mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
After reaching ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence , these kids go to work at the first opportunity .
It is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
&quot; You humili@@ ated and in@@ fer@@ ior . &quot;
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
Test@@ ing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status .
If they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
In the meantime , most of the m@@ igrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
&quot; Welcome , or No Un@@ authorized En@@ try &quot;
Many of the foreigners asser@@ t that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
The reason lies in bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and the already mentioned language difficulties .
In addition , leg@@ alization costs money : from 12@@ ,000 to 16@@ ,000 rub@@ les .
W@@ here@@ as a fa@@ ke registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand
Offic@@ ers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fa@@ ke papers , without registration , hence the ex@@ tor@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They ask for a hundred or two for cigare@@ ttes , tea , &quot; Um@@ ed K@@ hus@@ h@@ k@@ ad@@ am@@ ov , a citizen of Ta@@ j@@ ik@@ istan , shared with journalists .
&quot; R@@ oll up , don &apos;t be , get your art@@ work &quot;
On the first day of the law &apos;s entry into effect it turned out that not only m@@ igrant registration documents can be fa@@ ke .
A few for@@ ged certificates about passing language tests have been sei@@ zed by Federal Migration Services officers already . . . .
For@@ ged documents are printed on on a standard colour printer .
Naturally , were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way . paid seven thousand rub@@ les for them
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand .
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
For the moment , the authorities can promise m@@ igrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
In addition , those who come without Russian knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
The Ministry of the Inter@@ ior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Inter@@ ior is proposing to tou@@ gh@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons .
This is the reaction of authorities to and recent incidents : CL@@ IC@@ K shots at wed@@ dings , where there were no cas@@ u@@ alties , and the mass@@ ac@@ re st@@ aged by Moscow lawyer D@@ mit@@ ry Vin@@ ogra@@ do@@ v , resulting in CL@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people .
Po@@ lic@@ emen want want want want to prohi@@ bit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing are from 18 to 21 .
The idea was supported by the head of the Dum@@ a Committee on Safety and Anti@@ -@@ Cor@@ ruption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ aro@@ va@@ ya , who promised that the the the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the Dum@@ a in the near future .
Not everyone is happy happy happy happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by &quot; tigh@@ tening the scre@@ ws . &quot;
An open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social ri@@ f@@ le organizations - demand to abandon the &quot; sen@@ sel@@ ess tou@@ gh@@ ening . &quot;
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is , said criminal lawyer V@@ asi@@ ly Les@@ ni@@ ko@@ v to BBC Russia .
According to the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior statistics , 142 crimes using fire@@ arms registered . with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the the the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,@@ 16@@ 8@@ ,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
Auth@@ ors of the open letter are certain that it the tou@@ gh@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the the the the criminal from going to the &quot; black &quot; market .
According to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now .
Nonetheless , the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
Supp@@ liers : from plants to officers
The &quot; black &quot; market of weapons is re@@ plen@@ ished through several .
There are five such channels , explains reti@@ red colon@@ el Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of and the General Staff on for 10 years .
Screen@@ shot of the site that that that accepts orders for weapons .
First : &quot; army or or or military loo@@ t , &quot; i.e. weapons that were st@@ olen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
&quot; We@@ ap@@ ons were st@@ olen by Russian officers and by the Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans , &quot; says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
Next are &quot; black weapons , &quot; st@@ olen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police ware@@ houses those st@@ olen directly from law enforcement agencies &apos; employees .
Il@@ legal arms are taken to be sold from military ware@@ houses .
Explo@@ sions have often been heard at military ware@@ houses
&quot; There are proven the@@ ories that some of the fires were inten@@ tional , , in order to cover the shortage , &quot; says the former military man .
Manu@@ fac@@ tur@@ ers of weapons make their contribution , according to to Bar@@ an@@ ets .
&quot; There There There There are so many private weapons factories now , which do not end@@ ure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter the black market , including and in with , &quot; says the expert .
Another source of the &quot; black market is trafficking .
An especially number g@@ uns and machine g@@ uns come from poor countries like Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan .
&quot; There &apos;s production there , sometimes hand@@ made ; and a ma@@ fia has formed , which has organized a stream , &quot; explains the former military man .
Where do the weapons come from ?
Exper@@ ts counted the approxim@@ ate share of each of the sources of supply of of of of illegal weapons to the &quot; black &quot; market .
A report about this was prepared by the the Centre of Problems Analy@@ sis and Public Management Plan@@ ning in 2011 .
Exper@@ ts analy@@ sed the reports of the Department of the Inter@@ ior and Ros@@ stat , crimin@@ ology literature and open from port@@ als on weapons .
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
Hal@@ f of all arms on the black market are there &quot; because of officials , whose work is connected connected connected with weapons , &quot; states the report .
According to researchers &apos; data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , , , , 14 % is the@@ ft during production , 5 % is &quot; black archae@@ ology . &quot;
A sales consul@@ tant of of the weapons stores , who wished to remain anonymous , asser@@ ts that the weapons found by &quot; black &quot; dig@@ gers are not being bought any more , because they they they &apos;re too old .
According to him , dealers go to the military ware@@ house for a new bat@@ ch of goods .
One piece , for example a T@@ T gun can be bought from a warrant officer . . .
It is issued to him , and given through the f@@ ence .
&quot; He takes that it to the city and s@@ ells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines , &quot; he says .
&quot; The truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why perio@@ dic@@ ally , when the crime detection rate is low , it conduc@@ ts test purchases from illegal weapons merchan@@ ts , &quot; says the consul@@ tant .
&quot; Like in a luxury luxury luxury store &quot;
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , blo@@ gs , till someone responded , offering me to go to Beg@@ ov@@ aya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the &quot; corner &quot; so we can negotiate .
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military comm@@ ent@@ ator Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets
To get a weapon , I need someone with connections , says the sales consul@@ tant - I have an acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ance , but I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s reliable .
There are sal@@ es@@ men on labour markets , but one needs to &quot; come &quot; there condi@@ tionally &quot; from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his his daughter lost a to@@ oth . &quot;
Right now , even if I need a few k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ du@@ sters , I get them through someone I trust .
He also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won &apos;t give him away .
Beg@@ inn@@ ers look for weapons in different ways .
For@@ mer military man Vi@@ ktor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a illegal weapons in the mid@@ -@@ 1990 &apos;s when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
The formul@@ as are still the same , according to him .
He was given an album of pictures with &quot; anything and everything . &quot;
&quot; I felt like I was in a luxury store , &quot; he rec@@ alls .
According to Bar@@ an@@ ets , buyer is not a pi@@ g in a po@@ ke - you can try out everything .
I , to the potential client , am not just buying ; we we we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .
&quot; &quot; I am given the opportunity to sh@@ oot , and when I am certain that the is good , we begin begin to negotiate , &quot; describes the expert .
Store on a sofa
Internet sear@@ ches lead to sites and &quot; V@@ kon@@ ta@@ kte &quot; groups , where weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for different purposes &quot; are on offer .
No documents or personal meetings are needed .
&quot; It &apos;s enough to have a certain sum of money &quot; says the adverti@@ sement heading on the website &quot; Buy a p@@ ist@@ ol or ri@@ f@@ le &quot;

F@@ ast@@ -@@ food and super@@ market workers are on strike in the U.@@ S.@@ A .
Up to a fourth of all American te@@ en@@ agers have worked the cash register at Mc@@ Donald &apos;s at one with time or or another
In the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.@@ S.A. against low sal@@ aries in super@@ markets of the Wal@@ mar@@ t chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like Mc@@ Donald &apos;s , Bur@@ ger King , T@@ aco B@@ ell W@@ endy &apos;s and K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky Fri@@ ed Chi@@ cken .
Right , nobody is able to predic@@ t whether this wave will turn into the nin@@ th wave or it is dest@@ ined to fi@@ zzle out early .
Ac@@ tions are being supported by unions and a series of le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing .
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mar@@ t and fast food chains , the goal of the prote@@ sters is to create unions within them .
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet .
46 46 46 c@@ ents a year ?
Ac@@ tions began last with week after after Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clas@@ hes .
On this , some employees of the Wal@@ mar@@ t cor@@ poration , which emplo@@ ys 2.2 million people around the world , left their their their work@@ places and and pi@@ ck@@ eted together with the unions and le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing activists from the cor@@ poration stores that sell products to people on low@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ medium incomes .
Wal@@ mar@@ t s@@ ells everything imag@@ in@@ able , from di@@ apers , hunting ri@@ f@@ les and car of batteries , to vacuum clean@@ ers , eggs and milk .
Products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major super@@ markets .
So many many many many low@@ -@@ paid Wal@@ mar@@ t employees shop only at their workplace .
Avail@@ ability and assor@@ tment made Wal@@ mar@@ t one of the biggest American corporations .
According to critics , Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell the products che@@ ap@@ ly partly because it pays little to its employees .
These latter also compla@@ in about hard work conditions , example lack of lift tru@@ cks and hand@@ -@@ held scann@@ ers .
Prote@@ sters Black Friday demanded a sal@@ ary increase and compla@@ ined the cost of medical insurance provided by the cor@@ poration went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
A typical Wal@@ mar@@ t employee , receiving 9.@@ 5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
Scienti@@ sts from the Ber@@ kel@@ ey University in California argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t raises the average sal@@ ary to 12 / hour , it will cost the cor@@ poration 3.@@ 2 billion dollars .
This about 1.1 % more than it sp@@ ends on sal@@ aries right now .
If Wal@@ mar@@ t fully shi@@ fts the cost of increasing wages to the shoul@@ ders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 c@@ ents more .
In one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ mar@@ t supporters happ@@ ily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the cor@@ poration .
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday Thursday Thursday Thursday till mid@@ night the next day , and during the period Wal@@ mar@@ t sold about 5000 products a second .
In total , its cash regi@@ sters conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
of the cor@@ poration , D@@ an Fo@@ gel@@ man , asser@@ ted in an interview with a le@@ ft@@ -@@ wing site , be the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , that a total of &quot; than five &quot; Wal@@ mar@@ t employees left workplace , and the protest act was just &quot; another PR tri@@ ck &quot; of the union that organized it .
&quot; Free cash register ! &quot;
Pro@@ tests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ mar@@ t they &apos;re not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don &apos;t exist here yet ) , , , , but Mc@@ Donald &apos;s and other cheap restaurants .
Mc@@ Donald &apos;s says that it s@@ ells billions of of por@@ tions , and despite this it doesn &apos;t even give you si@@ ck days or pay you for honest work !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Willi@@ ams , member of the City Council of New York
At the moment , the minimum sal@@ ary according to federal and N@@ Y law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour .
Fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour .
N@@ obo@@ dy ear@@ ns less less less in this expensive city .
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
Once upon time , almost a fourth of American te@@ en@@ agers went through Mc@@ Donald &apos;s , working part@@ -@@ time after school , living with parents .
Fe@@ w saw this as a a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
Now I continuously come across inter@@ views with Mc@@ Donald &apos;s employees , who compla@@ in that they have survive this sal@@ ary and sometimes even feed their children .
On the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes it is ir@@ responsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
Particip@@ ants of the protest that began at 6.@@ 30 a.m. on Thursday near the Mc@@ Donald &apos;s on 40@@ th and Ma@@ dis@@ on Avenue demanded that cas@@ hi@@ ers and coo@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their present wages .
They , also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry .
American law prohi@@ bits administration from preventing this or pun@@ ishing activists of the union movement by n@@ ag@@ ging or fir@@ ing .
On the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life .
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
One of them is the unusual turnover of employees .
Dis@@ agre@@ eing
No@@ is@@ y protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near Mc@@ Donald by Times , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . One of them , Ju@@ ma@@ ane Willi@@ ams , said : &quot; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s claims it s@@ ells billions of por@@ tions , and this it doesn &apos;t even give you si@@ ck days or pay you for honest work ! &quot;
Demon@@ str@@ ators were supported by prominent N@@ Y demo@@ crats , like Bill de Bla@@ si@@ o , a candidate for N@@ Y city may@@ or , who said : &quot; We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can fair wages the and economic well@@ being , which every New Yor@@ ker deserves ! . . . &quot;
According to New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
But only few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast this food employees , which comp@@ rise tens of thousands of people in New York .
It is un@@ clear right now whether this will spar@@ k a mass movement .
&quot; At the , the mind cannot be dec@@ eived too well &quot;
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is au@@ g@@ mented reality , lat@@ ely seen primarily through the pr@@ ism of special gl@@ asses .
At first , functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . Then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too .
However according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft , Sha@@ h@@ ra@@ m Iz@@ adi , gl@@ asses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
They are drawn by the prospect of manipul@@ ating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces .
- Please tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does .
- We work on the interaction of of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
While that people in general are stu@@ ck at working with pi@@ xels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing we f@@ ing@@ ers at them .
We want to look 5@@ -@@ 10 years into the future and predic@@ t car@@ din@@ al changes in this interaction .
For example , X@@ box and Kin@@ ect sensors a step forward . Almost no X@@ box is sold without Kin@@ ect today , because everyone likes control by gest@@ ures .
- What else awa@@ its us in the future ?
- Despite the fact that Kin@@ ect shi@@ fted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
Information entry has improved the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
We are trying to change this , working on truly thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimensional display systems based on various technologies , including projec@@ tion technologies .
We need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
But for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him .
Then we will be able to supplement the real the world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
Above all , get rid of these stup@@ id virtual reality hel@@ m@@ ets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
It &apos;s a popular thing , but is it over@@ estimated ?
- It clearly cannot be called a cu@@ re@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ all - there &apos;s a question of , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions .
In reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own nich@@ e .
For example , we had a to control devices in public places , in in which we thought about movements , , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
Mo@@ vements were not recorded by a of camera , but by a hand this bra@@ cel@@ et that determined the movement of b@@ ones and mus@@ cles .
It &apos;s big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
In general , the future lies in the mixed control , e.g. movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water ?
You will talk and show at the same time .
- U@@ su@@ ally I just say .
- O@@ h , that will be very hard to detect .
- So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual with approxim@@ ation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of of a person &apos;s reaction .
This could be , e.g. laser sensors . They have a decent depth resolution , which is very and important .
- If we talk about your work with X@@ box Kin@@ ect sensors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
Not enough resolution , depth or something else
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimensional recognition .
Of course , it would be be be be good to have eight me@@ ga pi@@ xels with 1000 k / s s s speed .
It &apos;s not just the me@@ ga pi@@ xels , , but the quality of the mat@@ rix and the depth depth depth depth .
From the latter point of view , , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorith@@ m designers .
So it &apos;s important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also also the Z axis
Speed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
Human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gest@@ ures .
Ste@@ ven Ba@@ th@@ iche from our Red@@ mond laboratory created a touch with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indic@@ ator ( 60@@ -@@ 100 ) .
Not everyone understands , how this affects the interaction between man and machine .
In my work , it would be very useful to have a that not require tou@@ ching and would have more images per second .
- Does the number of cameras need need to be increased ?
- In Kin@@ ect there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an infra@@ red emit@@ ter and the second one one one one , the recipient of the signal .
The third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range .
It is not applied to determine the object &apos;s depth .
Pot@@ entially , a large number of cameras solve the problem ...
Or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calcul@@ ations .
It would be nice to create a flexible an@@ alogue Kin@@ ect , play with the flex@@ ion of camera dis@@ position and see how this will help in thre@@ e@@ -@@ dimensional determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its gl@@ asses to the Google .
Don &apos;t you think this is is is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of au@@ g@@ mented reality technologies ?
- Certainly it is not very convenient walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the cool@@ est option would be &quot; transitional &quot; au@@ g@@ mented reality , where you could shift from gl@@ asses to smart phone , projec@@ tion display , and everywhere else based on a clou@@ d platform .
Gl@@ asses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - au@@ g@@ mented reality based on gl@@ asses will not allow you to on virtual objects together with other people .
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual h@@ olo@@ graphic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from Iron@@ man , but to a regular person .
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no tac@@ tile feedback !
Hand@@ s feel nothing !
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
- In my lec@@ tures I often say that au@@ g@@ mented reality is the sevent@@ h consec@@ utive attempt at the interaction between man and machine machine machine machine .
I think that the eigh@@ th will probably be the addition of tac@@ tile sens@@ ations .
For now , one of the interesting tri@@ cks is to use the second hand as a sort of mat@@ rix for the image .
It is great at regi@@ stering pus@@ hes !
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these for &quot; images in in in in the air &quot; a a a a sense of tan@@ gi@@ bility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultra@@ sound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sen@@ sation , but very weak right now , if someone ble@@ w on your f@@ inger@@ tip .
There are also wr@@ ist bra@@ cel@@ ets that affect the ner@@ ve end@@ ings in f@@ ing@@ ers , which is also promising area .
- Have you tried to dec@@ eive the mind ?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something
- This is a good I idea and haven &apos;t tried this yet .
It conce@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physi@@ cally a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limit@@ less space ; we are working on the concept of tre@@ ad@@ m@@ ills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant bal@@ lo@@ ons . .
So far dec@@ ei@@ ving the mind has had limited success , there &apos;s work work many years to come .
That &apos;s what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginn@@ ings .
Ju@@ d@@ gement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ bal@@ t.@@ ru
Ros@@ b@@ alt continues the project St. Petersburg Av@@ ant@@ -@@ garde , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the av@@ ant@@ -@@ garde of culture and art .
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ing f@@ ame in Russia .
The new player in Ros@@ b@@ alt - the bold artist Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler . .
The whole city knows Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler , a be@@ arded man man man dres@@ sed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Summer Garden , or at fashi@@ onable parties and shows .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler &apos;s work always brings in crow@@ ds of people , no matter where they are exhi@@ bited .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler is one of the purely St. be Petersburg social and philos@@ ophi@@ cal stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers and cre@@ ators of new myth@@ ology .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Mil@@ ler is an outstanding man the St. Petersburg av@@ ant@@ -@@ garde of the late 80 &apos;s early 90 &apos;s .
Moreover , he is a city man , who makes people s@@ mile on the street and lifts up everyone &apos;s spirit .
he took up up up the street organ and became St. Petersburg &apos;s music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Boh@@ em@@ ian existence , philosophy and image .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , why do you around the city all in red , not yellow or tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise , for example ?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image .
In this world , red is a a a compromise between artist , ima@@ ge@@ -@@ maker and society .
Although in in in society , everything that is not grey causes aggres@@ sion and ag@@ itation of the bad kind .
But my pro@@ voc@@ ations are aimed at starting conversation .
The whole history of my pro@@ voc@@ ative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- When did you realise that that that that you must be an artist ?
- At an exhibition in the Nev@@ sky House of Culture , where my work was displayed .
It became clear to that this is is is is my path .
Then , the wave of older free , un@@ official artists was gone , while new , artists like me were not understood .
I became with the artists of the new wave , with post@@ -@@ Gaz@@ a@@ -@@ Nev@@ sky style artists ( &quot; post@@ -@@ gaz@@ on@@ ev@@ sch@@ ina &quot; ) , which led to P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer . . .
I &apos;m drawn to theatre , , clothing , music , all gen@@ res except for literature .
- And all this has been been been been united in your Art@@ -@@ clin@@ ic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
In , occupied the territory on P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and while the renovation work not started , there was a musical and creative club club club club , a Boh@@ em@@ ian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Boh@@ em@@ ia .
Many were born there : NO@@ My , Te@@ qu@@ ila Jazz , I remember when Sh@@ nur was there with the Van Go@@ gh &apos;s E@@ ar project .
Sh@@ nur and his friends li@@ p s@@ ang easy songs , wearing tight le@@ ot@@ ards , and the now trendy composer I@@ g@@ or V@@ do@@ vin was with them .
When the group began to play live , became became Len@@ ing@@ rad .
Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the present@@ er of many programs before H@@ ali@@ -@@ Gal@@ i times .
We gave them Tra@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and ment@@ oring he received from us .
Gallery D 137 , Gri@@ bo@@ y@@ ed@@ ov club - all these echo the Art@@ -@@ clin@@ ic .
That is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a her@@ o of the last century , when culture meant meant meant meant something .
In 2000 , there was a po@@ ll in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nom@@ inated Arti@@ st of the Year , my cli@@ max came to an end .
In the new times , it is un@@ comfortable to work by old rules . I &apos;m a man of truth , honest@@ y and culture the of the last century .
In our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . You can as be popular , but not very cultural . .
- Your work is marked by a recogni@@ z@@ able style .
- The Many of my works works are hits , with clearly reflected relevance and acu@@ ity .
I will have a programme exhi@@ bit , &quot; Russian museum in clo@@ wns . &quot;
Clo@@ wns are a tim@@ eless category .
I was social before , now it is is painful and sc@@ ary to be like that .
But everything is bl@@ urred in clo@@ wns , tragedy is removed .
I like gro@@ tes@@ que , I have gro@@ tes@@ que ideas .
For example , saving the world by totalit@@ arian changing of clothes by order .
Nowadays , , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities .
Who knows , maybe you cannot sha@@ ke his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face .
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes .
- Recently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should such a character .
Who fits role better than I ?
- Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- Nowadays commercial art should be ne@@ at , consider@@ ate , sweet .
There is a dis@@ integration of cultures .
People used get together in flo@@ cks , Boh@@ em@@ ians liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
Now , is divided into micro societies it &apos;s hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all .
Now you have to think who you will please .
Now , each cul@@ t her@@ o has 100 fans .
- But this several thousand come to St@@ as Mik@@ ha@@ i@@ lov !
- The cast@@ -@@ outs go to see him , the sexu@@ al@@ -@@ social sphere is at work there .
But in people will come for culture , not 10,000 . In the end , there less management , money everything dies .
I have fans ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them , not to spo@@ il what I have earned .
my youth I painted such art that collec@@ tor had it han@@ ging on same wall with Fal@@ k and L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov .
I started with paintings , which people usually end with .
Conc@@ ep@@ ts are often mixed up these .
People say : spiritual culture , consumer culture .
There is no culture in consu@@ mer@@ ism , it &apos;s &quot; from another opera . &quot;
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture . I grew on examples of artists who poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of painting .
This is the culture I &apos;m for .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , what is St. Petersburg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
There is such a thing : an official for culture .
But this not everyone can be engaged in culture
Under Under Under the right rul@@ ers everything was different . K@@ ings may have have have have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts .
There are consultants in Moscow right now .
Here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because advanced experts are needed who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
Ju@@ d@@ gement calls are what thri@@ ve now .
Even Er@@ art , but they &apos;re different because they say honest@@ ly that that that that we don &apos;t accept all modern art . There are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves .
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow Moscow Moscow has much more culture , there is bedro@@ ck there .
It &apos;s hard for art to grow on our rocks .
We need cultural bedro@@ ck , but we now have more writers than readers . This is wrong .
In Europe , there are many curi@@ ous people , who go to art exhi@@ bits , concerts .
Here , this layer is thin .
We need to make art fashi@@ onable , as it was the beginning of last century .
The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant .

The earth is danger .

Car@@ av@@ ans of co@@ sm@@ ic ships with humans on board leave in of a replacement planet .
To save humanity , the question is how to prop@@ ag@@ ate our race in in in conditions of wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness or on on that replacement planet ?
I think on the choice is small .
There are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be explo@@ red even hypo@@ the@@ tically .
&quot; Ven@@ us and Mars , , &quot; says Senior Res@@ ear@@ cher of the P@@ .@@ K. Sh@@ tern@@ berg State A@@ stronom@@ y Institute ( G@@ A@@ IS@@ h ) V@@ ladimir Sur@@ din .
But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life , Ven@@ us has 500@@ -@@ degree temperatures .
Life is possible only at a high altitude or on the or@@ bit of Ven@@ us ... in space .
The question of reproduction in space began with flora flora flora flora .
Hal@@ f a century ago ago ago , experiments were with run on plants .
Four generations of pe@@ as grown in or@@ bit were no different from their earth counter@@ parts .
Then , , in@@ sec@@ ts were b@@ red in or@@ bit , small fruit fli@@ es .
In 1979 , qu@@ ail eggs were sent to space , to check how an em@@ br@@ yo develops in wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness .
We get an absolutely normal ch@@ ick .
But then the problem begins .
&quot; The problem is and related to the fact that this ch@@ ick needs find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , &quot; explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Bi@@ ological Problems ( IM@@ B@@ P ) RA@@ N V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
Having found no no no support , chi@@ cks were tu@@ mb@@ ling around in dis@@ order .
After 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete at@@ roph@@ y of inst@@ inc@@ ts .
Chi@@ cks did not react to light and sound .
And the was that they simply died after four days .
&quot; We b@@ red chi@@ cks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there &quot; says says says says V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v , confir@@ ming the failure of the experiment with chi@@ cks in space .
The last biological &quot; mini@@ -@@ ark &quot; with animals fle@@ w into or@@ bit 16 years ago .
In spring 2013 , experiments will continue .
However , only sam@@ e@@ -@@ sex beings will be on the B@@ ion bio@@ -@@ satellite .
There was an experiment with rats , who were sent to space with fo@@ etus .
In principle , there was nothing extraordinary there . it
&quot; This was on bio@@ -@@ satelli@@ tes but again , it was a sing@@ ular experiment and such research needs to be conducted , &quot; says V@@ ladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
After landing , the co@@ sm@@ ic rats had bab@@ ies .
But it &apos;s hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space .
It &apos;s not an easy task .
Anim@@ als simply cannot follow their sexual inst@@ inc@@ t , when they &apos;re out of their familiar environment .
In In principle , people , unlike animals , can .
Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ iens have abstra@@ ct thinking , and are able to create a fitting emotional background .
Such experiments are not for ethical reasons .
But women have been flying to space for 50 years .
The biggest risk was for Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va .
The The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body .
Our &quot; Se@@ ag@@ ull &quot; and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space .
Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight .
&quot; N@@ obo@@ dy answered this question , &quot; says ro@@ cket and space industry veter@@ an , V@@ ak@@ ht@@ ang V@@ ach@@ n@@ ad@@ ze .
In June 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Valent@@ ina Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va gave birth to a daughter .
The child &apos;s father , An@@ dri@@ an Nikol@@ ae@@ v , was also a cos@@ mon@@ aut .
In 1988 , the second woman cos@@ mon@@ aut , Sv@@ et@@ lan@@ a Sav@@ it@@ sk@@ aya , who went into or@@ bit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
However , the risk risk remains .
We have few , very few cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts , who were OK and had healthy children after long flights .
&quot; What &apos;s more , it is dangerous even for or@@ b@@ ital flights , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds pilot and cos@@ mon@@ aut , Her@@ o of the US@@ SR , Her@@ o of Russia , Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov .
And yet , humanity needs seek out some new aven@@ ues biotechn@@ ologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial grav@@ ity .
Hydro@@ -@@ laboratory of CP@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight .
Here , cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zer@@ o@@ -@@ grav@@ ity conditions .
Water im@@ it@@ ates wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness .
If it for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for in@@ fan@@ ts it is a native element .
Small amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean .
There is a connection with with with with the fact that an inf@@ ant sp@@ ends about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ o@@ tic flu@@ id in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
In principle , it is is is is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing .
&quot; This is very little time to forget something , , , , &quot; says inf@@ ant swimming instruc@@ tor Marina Ak@@ sen@@ ova .
In other words , if for a new@@ born wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness is more natural , a a woman needs grav@@ ity , earth &apos;s pull .
St@@ om@@ ach and pel@@ vic mus@@ cles quickly de@@ generate in wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness ; the ability , to push out and the em@@ br@@ yo is reduced .
Well , let &apos;s assume that child@@ birth stimul@@ ators will work out .
Maybe she will will will will push out the baby in a special room .
&quot; Then what &quot; - asks Val@@ ery Poli@@ ak@@ ov about this non@@ -@@ tri@@ vi@@ al issue .
On the other hand , a baby also needs artificial grav@@ ity .
When a body does not feel the earth &apos;s pull , it does not form the sk@@ el@@ et@@ al and and mus@@ cular system .
It is not possible to dress a new@@ born in or@@ bit into a special loading suit for training as they do adults .
He will simply not have what he needs to survive .
&quot; And this experiment , that we will go for by allowing the birth a child child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a han@@ dic@@ apped , completely un@@ adapted human to . earth , &quot; predic@@ ts of the Committee on Bio@@ ethics IM@@ B@@ P RA@@ N I@@ g@@ or P@@ est@@ ov .
For the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory .
However , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their off@@ spring , who were born in space .
N@@ K@@ U Head : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians .
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of when when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their their application .
This was said by Mi@@ los@@ la@@ v Kal@@ a , vic@@ e@@ -@@ president of the Supreme Au@@ dit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for Aktu@@ al@@ ne@@ .@@ cz .
&quot; The will never be perfect , but application should be just just just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , &quot; states Kal@@ a , comm@@ enting on the current situation .
Simil@@ ar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and and German audi@@ tors .
As an example of impro@@ per practice , they c@@ ite Pet@@ r N@@ ec@@ as &apos;s to the so@@ -@@ called &quot; S@@ var@@ c System . &quot;
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden forbidden forbidden forbidden or allowed ?
&quot; The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ ut@@ y@@ -@@ bound to monitor and enforce , &quot; asser@@ ts Kal@@ a .
At the audit committee &apos;s session in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties , you spoke about a joint project between between between between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
What exactly was this about ?
This is about parallel audi@@ ting , , which we began around two years ago .
Simply put , this is about how European govern@@ s the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legisl@@ ations then the actual practice itself .
We brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting interesting interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even &quot; more conc@@ ise and complete , &quot; however the actual practice is in in in certain aspects better in Germany .
This confirms that creating more and more conc@@ ise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to to to the actual application of these laws .
What does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
This kind of joint audit could contribute to cur@@ ta@@ iling these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a a a positive impact .
Economy means means means means acqu@@ iring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price so that profit@@ e@@ ering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided .
However , and just because we have have have have the order limits , does not mean something will be proc@@ ured .
The system might become over@@ loaded with the amount of pap@@ er@@ work , and those , who wish to look for lo@@ op@@ holes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits to had higher .
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts .
How does the audit system work in Germany ?
Is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or organised differently ?
As far as the office office is concerned , the Bundes@@ rechn@@ ung@@ shof functions our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices offices offices offices operate simil@@ arly .
Po@@ wers are also similar similar similar similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised feder@@ ally , so these courts of audi@@ tors are are are are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly diff@@ ers from our own .
The BR@@ H can only audit federal federal money , known to us as state funds .
Public funds , which , us , are are are administ@@ ered by regional and municipal authorities , are audi@@ ted by the federal courts of audi@@ tors there .
When it comes to their legislation , is it it it more straight@@ forward than ours ?
Over@@ all , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
Is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
That is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such compar@@ isons .
It should that even in a country we perc@@ eive as exempl@@ ary , they encounter whole range of problems .
If that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
Com@@ ing back to domestic legislation , , , , what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being being felt already ?
The period The since the amendment came into force has been quite quite quite quite short , so it has not not not not manifest@@ ed itself in our audit audit audit work yet .
Since we carry out our audi@@ ts ex@@ -@@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account .
As yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audi@@ ts - we have launched our new &quot; fiscal failure risk detection &quot; system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analy@@ sed - that is where changes will clearly seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
So do you for see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as as as as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I this will be confirmed .
A problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes &quot; too too constra@@ ined &quot; and , will not be enfor@@ ce@@ able .
Under the previous rules , parties being audi@@ ted were were were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline .
Is it worth constra@@ ining the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not pen@@ alise those , who make a mistake on a techn@@ ic@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision .
This kind of system will only increase on bureaucracy .
So how can we get out of this ?
Let &apos;s see where this dead@@ -@@ end takes us .
The Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be bur@@ dening business@@ men with audi@@ ts of the so@@ -@@ called &quot; S@@ var@@ c System &quot; - what this mean
Is the S@@ var@@ c System prohibited or allowed ?
The Law must be set out one way or the other , , , , and if it prohi@@ bits something , on then even the Government &apos;s head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ ut@@ y@@ -@@ bound to to to monitor and enforce .
He may say : &quot; Let us change this law and relax it , &quot; but he cannot say we should pre@@ tend it is not there .
The law on public has relatively strict rules about the formali@@ ties which must be adher@@ ed to - which is the right way to ensure public ten@@ ders are protected .
On the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bi@@ d@@ der with the best offer is excluded on a techn@@ ic@@ ality .
The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
Ro@@ ads are ic@@ y in places , but mostly pass@@ able .
In several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are ic@@ y and snow@@ y .
However , the majority of is roads are pass@@ able , with extra care needed in in in in places .
Carl@@ s@@ bad region
In the Carl@@ s@@ bad region , , the roads have been us@@ able this morning , though in some places they were ic@@ y and and and snow@@ y .
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
S@@ no@@ wing in the region has stopped , and only a thin layer of snow remains in the low@@ lands .
However , the ri@@ dges of the K@@ rus@@ ne Mountains have around 30 cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
In some locations there is limited visibility due to m@@ ist , according to the local highway service .
The R@@ 6 high@@ -@@ speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now us@@ able without restriction .
Cau@@ tion is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be ic@@ y and sli@@ p@@ per@@ y .
All secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are also pass@@ able , including mountain roads .
In certain stret@@ ches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and comp@@ acted snow pat@@ ches .
Above all , at higher levels , extra care be taken while driving .
Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce and H@@ ra@@ dec Kr@@ alo@@ ve region
On some roads in Eastern Boh@@ em@@ ia , there there might be be be a risk of black , at higher al@@ titudes and and and and in the mountains there might be a layer comp@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Motor@@ way Direc@@ torate .
The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher al@@ titudes of the Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce region in particular .
Black ice may occur around Lan@@ sk@@ rou@@ n , U@@ sti n@@ ad Or@@ lic@@ i , Poli@@ cky , S@@ vit@@ av@@ y , and V@@ y@@ so@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads .
The I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ av@@ y .
S@@ now is particularly the roads in the Kr@@ kon@@ ose and Or@@ li@@ cke mountains .
At At higher al@@ titudes , there is a comp@@ acted snow layer on the roads around Ry@@ chno@@ v n@@ ad K@@ ne@@ z@@ no@@ u and Tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
In Eastern Boh@@ em@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and dry .
Temperat@@ ures will be between min@@ us three and plus one degree Cel@@ si@@ us mostly , with a light wind .
Pil@@ sen region
The roads in the Pil@@ sen region have been us@@ able this and morning , with extra care needed in some places . Dri@@ vers should take the weather conditions into account .
The morning will be fro@@ sty , with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero .
Due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature temperature temperature temperature , roads may be ic@@ y .
Dri@@ vers should expect m@@ ist in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
This information was reported by the region &apos;s highway service .
The D@@ 5 motorway is dri@@ vable almost without , but the road services recommend extra cau@@ tion between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1st kilomet@@ re marks .
Most primary road surfaces are dry and fro@@ st@@ -@@ free .
areas of the Pil@@ sen and T@@ ach@@ ov regions may have ic@@ y pat@@ ches .
Sec@@ on@@ dary and ter@@ ti@@ ary roads are wet , and therefore also have ic@@ y pat@@ ches .
Dri@@ vers should be cau@@ tious especially on less frequ@@ ented roads in the Boh@@ em@@ ian Forest .
Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
Dri@@ vers should expect snow s@@ lush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ k@@ se sed@@ lo and on the way to Vi@@ del@@ sky Kri@@ z .
Snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were brought out by falling snow overnight , the Sum@@ per@@ k region , according to highway maintenance , got around three cen@@ timet@@ res of snow .
In other parts the region , roads are mainly pass@@ able without restrictions
In the Sum@@ per@@ k region , traces of snow have remained at the highest al@@ titudes .
Dri@@ vers should expect expect expect expect snow s@@ lush at Cer@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ s@@ ke sed@@ lo in the direction of Jes@@ en@@ ik , &quot; the disp@@ at@@ ch officer for the Sum@@ per@@ k highway service told C@@ T@@ K today .
Their Jes@@ en@@ ik counter@@ parts also made an ou@@ ting overnight ; the all the way to the highest al@@ titudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them .
The Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region &apos;s roads are us@@ able without restriction , while in the area of Stern@@ ber@@ k drivers drivers drivers should be@@ ware in woo@@ ded areas , where roads have remained wet .
U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region , Liber@@ ec region
Since this morning , the snow@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s have reported several places , which are to pass in northern Boh@@ em@@ ia .
Besides certain snow@@ -@@ covered places , or some ic@@ y fro@@ st pat@@ ches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ ini@@ ce in the U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region is also closed , according to the police database .
Temperat@@ ures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snow@@ y and ic@@ y . In the low@@ lands , however , particularly sou@@ theast of the Central Boh@@ em@@ ian U@@ pl@@ ands , are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
traffic hol@@ d@@ -@@ ups have so far been reported .
I@@ cy fro@@ st pat@@ ches have been in particular by road maintenance around St@@ et@@ i
According to met@@ e@@ or@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and mel@@ ting snow during the day , with a clear night and free@@ zing temperatures .
Ad@@ verse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m and Liber@@ ec regions .
The closure of the Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ ini@@ ce road was caused by b@@ ent tree branches , to which were weigh@@ ed down to road level by snow@@ fall .
Simon Or@@ n@@ est : At the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
It is just another star@@ t@@ ler , which we to lat@@ ch on to .
Together with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , we tend to jo@@ ke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or aver@@ t the end of the world completely .
In you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world .
Can you give our readers some details on this ?
This is a nation@@ wide fund@@ -@@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the May@@ an calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m .
On the eve , the 20th of December , at 9@@ pm , 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague , Br@@ no , and O@@ stra@@ va .
They will end end at around the time when Ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the May@@ an calendar .
Who came up with this idea ? ? ? ?
Initi@@ ally it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our designer , Hon@@ za Augu@@ sta .
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts that for the state of our planet , is when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
On the occasion of the end of the May@@ an calendar , we have also prepared a a a a range of unique items shoes , t@@ -@@ shi@@ rts , bags , The and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at www.@@ e@@ -@@ ta@@ p.@@ cz to support our cause .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , together with other artists for , also recorded the so@@ -@@ called an@@ them against the end of the world , called &quot; The End of the World is cancelled . &quot;
It is already well received on YouTube , will figure at the fund@@ -@@ raising concerts ?
Of course , for the grand fin@@ ale , as long as the world does not end be@@ fore@@ hand .
It will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time .
The an@@ them will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Tel@@ evision .
The words were written and the role of Jesus in the video cli@@ p was played by T@@ omas Han@@ ak , X@@ ind@@ l X also s@@ ings in it ...
How did you end up working with them
We collabor@@ ate also with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scene , due to organising a lot of fund@@ -@@ raising events and concerts ...
We try to really get them involved in these projects .
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
What will the proce@@ eds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
Equi@@ pping the whe@@ el@@ chair@@ -@@ accessible educational Stu@@ de@@ o centre , which is already its sixth year , in collaboration with citizens association Ta@@ p from the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute for the disabled .
Tut@@ ors come in regularly to spend time with the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute &apos;s students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tut@@ ors , so we to provide this for them in this way . . .
Within the construction project at the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
Every to concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists .
How do you select them ?
We have tried to comp@@ ile a programme , speaks for all ages , including children .
For example , in Prague , Chin@@ as@@ ki , Support Les@@ bi@@ ens , Illu@@ str@@ ato@@ sphere with D@@ an Bar@@ ta , The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p , M@@ arian Ban@@ go and J@@ ir@@ i Such@@ y will appear .
Further details can found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ ks@@ .@@ cz .
Are you planning any more &quot; bom@@ b@@ astic events &quot; in the future ?
In , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good lin@@ e@@ -@@ up with some interesting guests .
Next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appe@@ aran@@ ces in Washington and Chicago .
Your international plans plans are not not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is nonetheless a band composed of han@@ dic@@ apped people .
How do you cope with these jour@@ neys in terms of logistics and organisation ?
It is not as sc@@ ary it might seem at first
We have five members in electric whe@@ el@@ chairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of of of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage luggage luggage and instrument cases ...
Nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , C@@ SA and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
Even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smooth@@ ly .
Thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues , public to dis@@ ability and so on .
What have been been been your experiences so far
After Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginn@@ ings .
Comp@@ ared to Prague , Moscow is the rather in@@ accessible it still still still still remains unusual there for a person in an electric whe@@ el@@ chair to be travelling around city centre on or her own .
Ob@@ vious things things things things , such giving whe@@ el@@ chairs priority in in in lifts , are not comm@@ on@@ place there .
, citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
And on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more advanced countries ?
There are lot of things , which we still lag behind on ...
It is important important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected .
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious han@@ di@@ cap@@ s to for be independently independently out in public , and they can use the toi@@ lets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
It is less common there with for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with Ta@@ p Ta@@ p we are a step ahead !
Public respect or accessibility accessibility accessibility accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athle@@ tes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
So far there are only exceptional cases , people who are strong@@ -@@ will@@ ed .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band currently very popular , but let us look back a few few few few years , what promp@@ ted you in 1998 to form it ?
I began my job a tut@@ or the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were in doing something .
Since I am musi@@ cian myself - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ oph@@ one - I started a music club with a colleague .
With time , our moder@@ ator Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovi@@ c says , it has grown grown grown a little out of our control ( lau@@ gh ) .
Your popularity has only come come come come about in the last few years , or am I are mistak@@ en ?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous sing@@ ers and also by our pro@@ active work the band .
We realised that work , which goes on un@@ seen can be like it never existed .
Thanks to funds from the . European Union we can even afford top quality tut@@ ors , equipment and so on .
Was it your goal to take The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p to such hei@@ ghts ?
From the outset , I felt there was potential to do things a little differently .
Show business is filled with things , where one im@@ it@@ ates the other .
It is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hesit@@ antly and take a long time .
Th@@ ings , which are unique are few and far between , but I would dare to claim that Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is one of those things .
A person &apos;s first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is natural reaction ...
But that pity is simply wa@@ sted , because han@@ dic@@ apped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be pi@@ tied .
They are people , who can fully live life and be b@@ los@@ som , assum@@ ing , of course , that they have have have have the right environment for it it it .
I say that when a person with a han@@ dic@@ ap succe@@ eds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many many people are sugge@@ sting ?
If we want to achieve top in class work , we must be un@@ com@@ promising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
I think this is to be expected .
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clou@@ ds , and when they find out they have to go to re@@ hear@@ s@@ als twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly dis@@ appears .
That is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band currently has twenty members . we
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
Only , Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovi@@ c . . .
We are an an an open group , people come and people go , this is un@@ avoid@@ able .
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open .
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9@@ pm .
The venues will be Pra@@ ha In@@ ch@@ eb@@ a , Br@@ no Fle@@ da , and O@@ stra@@ va P@@ ly@@ no@@ j@@ em with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from Czech Republic .
All three cities will be joined by a tel@@ ev@@ ised lin@@ k@@ -@@ up at the evening &apos;s close for a united ren@@ dition of The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p &apos;s an@@ them &quot; The End of the World is cancelled &quot;
The concert &apos;s goal is to raise funds to equi@@ p the ST@@ U@@ DE@@ O multi@@ -@@ functional whe@@ el@@ -@@ chair accessible learning centre at the Jed@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech cro@@ wns .
Ad@@ mission fee to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 12 12 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from Boh@@ em@@ i@@ ati@@ cket .
Poland it and the Co@@ smo@@ s .
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the twen@@ tieth member of of the agency , being being being being the second nation from the former Eastern Block ( after the Czech , which became a fully fle@@ dged member of the ESA on on the 12th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
Of course , Poland &apos;s path to the space had begun earlier .
Polish b@@ off@@ ins devoted their time to space even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the lec@@ ture of A Stern@@ feld in Warsaw &apos;s astronom@@ y ob@@ servatory , who , on the 6th of December 19@@ 33 , presented ideas on his pione@@ ering work En@@ try into space .
The thoughts of the young engine@@ er ( born 19@@ 05 ) left his audience cold , and years later Stern@@ feld remember@@ ed that only Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski had shown an interest in his work .
In 19@@ 34 , for his work En@@ try into space , Stern@@ feld received the Robert E@@ sn@@ aul@@ t@@ -@@ Pel@@ terie and And@@ re Louis Hir@@ sch prize in France .
The above mentioned Dr. Jan Gad@@ om@@ ski ( of 18@@ 99 - 1966 ) later became a strong promot@@ er of astronom@@ y and a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journ@@ als , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
Gad@@ om@@ ski became a wor@@ ld@@ -@@ known promot@@ er of of a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recognised when a cr@@ ater on the far side of the Mo@@ on was named after him .
In 19@@ 25 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to to to to be fitted with a ro@@ cket engine .
Unfortunately , both the project &apos;s designer , and the project &apos;s details , are unknown .
It is not even clear , whether the ro@@ cket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down .
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time .
In 19@@ 33 the Polish arti@@ ll@@ ery started their engagement in flying bom@@ bs .
The research was undertaken by the We@@ ap@@ ons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mi@@ ec@@ zy@@ s@@ law Wolf@@ ke and Prof. Gu@@ sta@@ w Mo@@ kr@@ zy@@ ck@@ i .
From the documents documents , it is clear that research reached the stage of practical tests .
Of course , the advance of the German army inter@@ rupted the research .
In 19@@ 37 , the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing ro@@ cket designed by engine@@ er Ro@@ ho@@ zin@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Ro@@ cket - air tor@@ p@@ edo and flying ro@@ cket@@ -@@ bom@@ b appeared , au@@ tho@@ red Le@@ li@@ wy@@ -@@ Kr@@ y@@ w@@ ob@@ lock@@ i .
Both projects were dest@@ ined for military use of ro@@ cket engines .
Im@@ medi@@ ately prior to the the War , projects for military use of ro@@ cket technologies were over@@ seen by the Provi@@ sional Scientific Ad@@ visory Board ( Ty@@ m@@ cz@@ as@@ ow@@ y Komit@@ et Dor@@ ad@@ c@@ zo@@ -@@ Nau@@ ko@@ w@@ y ) that coordinated all the work
The Board was appointed in 19@@ 37 , but after two two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War .
Further work devoted to a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish Polish Polish A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ sk@@ ie To@@ war@@ z@@ yst@@ wo A@@ stron@@ au@@ ty@@ cz@@ ne ) .
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 195@@ 4 , in which four in@@ -@@ depth articles are on the subject of a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
In one of these , by Prof. Sub@@ ot@@ o@@ wi@@ cz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedic@@ ate itself to a@@ stron@@ au@@ tics .
At the time , there were already projects under@@ way for artificial satelli@@ tes and it was clear that co@@ sm@@ ic research was an emerging sector . .
From the beginning of 1956 , the Polish A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Company ( P@@ TA ) sought entry to the International A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Federation est . 195@@ 1 ) and by autumn the P@@ TA was already a full member .
In the following year , , , , the P@@ TA &apos;s first chairman , Kaz@@ im@@ ier@@ z Z@@ aran@@ k@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz ( 19@@ 02 - 195@@ 9 ) ) ) ) was to appointed Dep@@ uty Chairman for the International A@@ stron@@ au@@ tics Federation .
He served in this capacity until his death in 195@@ 9 .
From 1956 , P@@ TA played a significant role in the successful development of met@@ e@@ or@@ ological ro@@ ckets R@@ M ( Rak@@ i@@ eta Met@@ e@@ or@@ ologi@@ cz@@ na ) , which became the first Polish be ro@@ cket to enable scientific research .
The first R@@ M@@ -@@ 1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch place on the 10th of October 1958 .
The ro@@ cket , with a ceiling of 18@@ 00 metres , measured around 80 cm in length and weigh@@ ed a little under 5 kg .
Later , the improved R@@ M@@ -@@ 1@@ A version was constructed and in the summer of 195@@ 9 launch tests were initiated for the tw@@ o@@ -@@ stage R@@ M@@ -@@ 2 ro@@ cket in the B@@ le@@ dow@@ sky Des@@ ert .
The ro@@ cket was 1.4 metres in length and weigh@@ ed approximately 11.@@ 5 kg .
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M@@ -@@ 34 ro@@ cket to reach 14.@@ 5 km and be t@@ asked with monitoring high altitude win@@ ds .
Of course , in 1962 further research was stopped .
The successor to the R@@ M ro@@ cket type was the Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 1 ro@@ cket , developed from 1962 to 1965 .
The ro@@ cket was designed as a tw@@ o@@ -@@ stage ro@@ cket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 cm and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg .
Three models were developed developed ( designated Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which differ@@ ed in the room available for scientific appar@@ atus .
In the Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ A ro@@ cket , , , a space of 0.@@ 4 lit@@ res was available , Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ B had 0.@@ 34 lit@@ res , and Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 lit@@ res .
The maximum altitude for all three models was 3@@ 7@@ km .
Between 1965 and 1968 , the development of of of Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 2 was under@@ way in the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 .
The Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 2 ro@@ cket had a launch weight of 3@@ 80 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60@@ km .
Sub@@ sequently built models were the Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 2@@ H and Met@@ e@@ or@@ -@@ 3 .
Poland &apos;s admission to CO@@ SP@@ AR ( for Space Research ) in should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ SP@@ AR board two years later .
Poland also participated in the Inter@@ ko@@ smo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satelli@@ tes , and in 1978 , the pilot Mi@@ ro@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ ze@@ wski became the second inter@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut after V@@ ladimir Rem@@ ko@@ v .
Ab@@ oli@@ shing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
Last week the Constitutional Court abolished the the the law on public works . .
The resolution caused lively public debate .
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective .
Liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU just as those in the glob@@ alised , based on the principle of an un@@ regulated economic competition .
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
The cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely un@@ regulated movement of private capital together with un@@ controlled financial speculation .
Due to significant labour cost differences ( sal@@ aries ) there is pressure on prices .
On this basis , it should be understood that when a tries to compete in a commercial tender by im@@ porting cheap goods , &quot; the rug is pul@@ led &quot; from under the competition . &apos;s prices prices prices prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
On a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import che@@ ap@@ ly from abroad , or close down . The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies .
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by a the unemployment it causes causes causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
The whole situation is bol@@ stered by the business@@ man &apos;s complete un@@ willingness to pay taxes , which would allevi@@ ate the economical and social harm caused the pursuit of profit .
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data .
The ru@@ th@@ less private capital practices practices practices create particular economic situations , where the in these countries , is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to arti@@ fici@@ ally lower the social standard of of of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
In other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while dis@@ regarding the drop in social standards .
This occurs chie@@ fly in amendments to existing law .
The aim is to economically force the the the domestic population to accept prices dict@@ ated by private capital , especially in terms of sal@@ aries .
On one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long@@ -@@ term unemployment , on other , restricted employee rights in the workplace .
This yiel@@ ds growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich .
In Germany there are already a host of of food hand@@ -@@ out centres for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
The number of these people is already in the millions .
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that that that properly employed people receive such a sal@@ ary that the State needs to top it up to as the minimum wage .
Just such a scandal revealed in the case of au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary staff in the Bun@@ de@@ stag . . . .
The austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation , where people are pres@@ su@@ red by a catastrop@@ hi@@ c drop in living standards to em@@ ig@@ rate as it was in the 19th century , or to e@@ ke out an existence on star@@ vation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the the the country will eventually see see some foreign investment .
At this point we have to ask where this may come from from from from ?
If it is to come from other EU EU states , then poverty is being shi@@ fted from one country to another , or it will not come all , because Chinese , Indian , Brazilian , Turkish , Mor@@ oc@@ can , Egyptian , and African labour is still at a a a fra@@ ction of of of of European wages .
This applies to all of Latin America .
Liberal theory and the Media inc@@ ess@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic ru@@ in .
Private capital cru@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts on the view@@ point that the State must must must must not intervene the economy .
Ther@@ eu@@ p@@ on , we should ask ourselves whether private has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own sel@@ fish ends .
Here , the answer must be yes .
The proof is the existence of the almost om@@ ni@@ pot@@ ent , and in all states , om@@ ni@@ present lobby .
The result is a desper@@ ate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is pun@@ is@@ hab@@ le .
In In Germany the situation is such that state mini@@ stri@@ es , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .
These laws are then approved in the Bun@@ de@@ stag .
Real power does not come from the people as the West@@ ern@@ -@@ style constitu@@ tions claim , but from strong financial organisations that that that that look after their own interests .
It is clear that liber@@ all@@ y@@ -@@ orient@@ ated democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by App@@ ian in his work on the Roman Republic Cri@@ sis in the time of Ces@@ ar and Pom@@ pe@@ i : &quot; The State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force . . . .
With bri@@ ber@@ y , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or s@@ words .
Bri@@ ber@@ y and corruption corruption were ri@@ fe and un@@ hin@@ dered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought &quot; ... &quot; people with did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole deb@@ ac@@ le meant the state went eight months without consu@@ ls .. &quot; .. &quot; There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cracy , and an energe@@ tic man should be elected . &quot; App@@ ian had Pom@@ pe@@ i in mind , but it was Ces@@ ar who changed democracy for auto@@ cracy permanently .
The conclusion , just as in anti@@ qu@@ ity , the current society is built on un@@ sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous tenden@@ cies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
Private capital capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
The outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented dec@@ ad@@ ence of the elite with no no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
The caus@@ ality of the rise of the fasc@@ ist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the mis@@ guided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries .
The current state of affairs , when we the dem@@ ise of those systems in favour of liber@@ alised democracy as an inter@@ lu@@ de , can expect its next cycle .
The particularly catastrop@@ hi@@ c reality is that the current elite is completely ignor@@ ing the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social , which we are already witn@@ essing , as well as crimes against against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
The abolition of the law on public works is not on the answer , at least not in the long term .
Under the pressure of economic competition internationally as well as within Europe , the of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lo@@ wering the population &apos;s living standards .
This pattern is thus system@@ ic .
To address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state &apos;s capital participation in the economy , increase the people &apos;s influence over the state and weak@@ en the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : Chaos .
&quot; Nothing comes from violence and and nothing ever could , &quot; from St@@ ing &apos;s Fra@@ gi@@ le , where one of the main ver@@ ses from the refra@@ in is &quot; L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . &quot;
&quot; If my sons did not want war , there would be be be none , &quot; said the dying Gut@@ le Schn@@ app@@ er , wife of Ma@@ yer Am@@ sch@@ el Roth@@ schil@@ d in 18@@ 49 .
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip , as always always always , has spark@@ ed a lot reaction .
Some stand by , argu@@ ing it the right to sel@@ f@@ -@@ defence , and Palestinians are portra@@ yed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claim@@ ing racism by the Israeli state , claim@@ ing that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Ara@@ bs , and that Israel is this a terrorist state .
I do not want to d@@ well , in these repeated peri@@ odi@@ c waves of killing , on who is the trans@@ gres@@ sor and who is the victim , after all , today &apos;s inhabitants of , including the sel@@ f@@ -@@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
I would like to offer the readers it a pe@@ ek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 9@@ 5@@ -@@ year long is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four &apos;s declaration in November 19@@ 17 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East .
Some of my thoughts be are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
Human history is in the instance about the struggle for power .
In every era we can find an Alexander the or a Napole@@ on .
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their thr@@ one stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre@@ -@@ calculated goal .
We must accept we live in a time when the the world &apos;s wealth is concentrated concentrated concentrated concentrated the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it ex@@ u@@ des could not in one generation &apos;s li@@ fes@@ pan .
Among these astronom@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the pu@@ pp@@ et master ( whether else stands above them , I am un@@ sure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ schil@@ ds .
Not much is written about them .
Under@@ stand@@ ably .
The first news agency ( Re@@ u@@ ters ) they bought in the 90 &apos;s of the 19th century in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high crimin@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both .
They hold majority st@@ akes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war ( before the ass@@ ault Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the over@@ throw of K@@ ad@@ da@@ fi 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
W@@ ho@@ ever attempted to def@@ y this family died .
Abra@@ ham L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n refused to rene@@ w the status of the central bank to the Roth@@ schil@@ d Bank of America , and during the in Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is stat@@ e@@ -@@ issued ) money and was ass@@ ass@@ inated in 18@@ 65 at the theatre .
J@@ F@@ K began issuing his money and wanted wanted wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1963 , Con@@ gres@@ sman Louis Mc@@ F@@ ad@@ den was po@@ is@@ oned in 19@@ 36 , after he had intended to su@@ e the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 19@@ 29 .
Their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the form@@ ulation of of of a thre@@ e@@ -@@ wor@@ ld@@ -@@ war plan by the fre@@ em@@ ason leader of the 3@@ 3rd degree Albert Pi@@ ke .
The first war was to remove the large mon@@ arch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the was to remove colonial rule , , , , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world &apos;s population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of sla@@ ves will suff@@ ice for their comfort and luxury , and will will will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ec@@ umen@@ ism is just an appe@@ ti@@ ser for this solution ) , and finally the sei@@ zing of absolute power .
The method , the of weal@@ thy families with the Roth@@ schil@@ ds leading the way , employ is the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab cha@@ o - order from chaos ) .
These solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vi@@ de establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 19@@ 07 would not be repeated ) . .
Thus , having succeeded in ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ating Fer@@ din@@ and , the Hab@@ sburg h@@ eir to the the the Au@@ stro@@ -@@ Hungarian thr@@ one , in Sar@@ aj@@ evo thereby un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing World War I , they destroyed ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k revolution .
The First World War ended ab@@ rup@@ tly , milit@@ arily and economically un@@ substanti@@ ated , with German capit@@ ulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ ar@@ ist Russia and the central powers of Austri@@ a@@ -@@ Hungary were subsequently disman@@ tled .
To facilitate the inc@@ eption of the Second World War , they allowed ban@@ kers and politicians to create a lat@@ ent conflict by s@@ add@@ ling Germany with huge war repar@@ ations , thereby making a radic@@ alist example of the im@@ pover@@ ished m@@ asses , it of remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing cul@@ pri@@ t and a leader a simple solution , while also creating a multi@@ -@@ ra@@ cial Cz@@ echo@@ slo@@ v@@ akia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth col@@ ony , once the war had been ign@@ ited . of
At the end of the 19th Century , the Roth@@ schil@@ ds in@@ sti@@ g@@ ated the establishment of the Zi@@ on@@ ist movement , one branch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Retur@@ n to Z@@ ion ) .
The af@@ ore@@ mentioned Bal@@ four Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
Terror@@ ist attacks occurred on both sides .
World War II broke out , and whether Hitler free from the le@@ ash , which international ban@@ kers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the to the world &apos;s acceptance of the Jewish the State .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and as the war repar@@ ations for War II were la@@ yed on Germany , the announcement of in the State of Israel became the third war &apos;s hot@@ bed .
Provi@@ ded the international ban@@ kers succeed , the Jewish Nation as with the second , will be the victims on front line , now together with the Ara@@ bic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East East East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of dis@@ cor@@ d chaos not only within the country , be but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is the w@@ ron@@ g@@ -@@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Palest@@ ine@@ -@@ Israel conflict , where in@@ justice bre@@ eds in@@ justice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the gre@@ ed a few and their lust for global power ?
Here , we must differenti@@ ate between Israel &apos;s general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international ban@@ kers introduce their own of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel &apos;s current prime minister , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u &apos; the ha@@ w@@ k &apos; , is a typical example of a a a fasc@@ ist politi@@ cian , lo@@ yal to the international international ban@@ kers , who does everything to in@@ sti@@ gate war with Iran , which would , due to its in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hor@@ mu@@ z Stra@@ it , where 20 % of on the world &apos;s oil must sa@@ il ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world &apos;s economy .
In what light stand the , spoken by David Rock@@ ef@@ eller in 1994 : &quot; All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . &quot;
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave .
A world where the rest of the human population population population serve the luxury of a hand@@ ful of financial ari@@ sto@@ crats .
A world , where new@@ -@@ born is im@@ plan@@ ted with a chip , which makes their existence sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ated .
&quot; He also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name .
If anyone has insight , let him calcul@@ ate the number of the be@@ ast ,
for it is man &apos;s number . His number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . &quot;
Ar@@ go : When things are at their worst - call Hollywood .
In November 1979 , a mo@@ b of Islamic student demonstr@@ ators took over the American emb@@ assy in Teh@@ ran and held 52 with diplom@@ ats ho@@ stage .
They were to be released in exchange for over@@ thrown Sha@@ h Moh@@ am@@ mad Re@@ za P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , who fl@@ ed after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several .
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Sha@@ h over@@ board , because this would seriously jeop@@ ardi@@ se the trust of other al@@ lied countries .
The release of the host@@ ages in Iran , where the the the the revolution resulted in the establishment of the the@@ o@@ cratic regime , could not be achieved .
This was a blow to the pres@@ tige of the States , which was later compo@@ unded by the fi@@ as@@ co of attempting to free the host@@ ages by force .
The inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated diplom@@ ats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Alger@@ ian government
Their or@@ deal prov@@ oked a wave of solidarity and anti@@ -@@ Iranian feelings at home .
The deb@@ ac@@ le in Iran significantly influenced J@@ im@@ my Car@@ ter &apos;s loss with Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan in the 1980 presidential elections .
The film Ar@@ go , directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck , re@@ counts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory .
Just before emb@@ assy was sei@@ zed , six employees escap@@ ed .
After some peri@@ pet@@ ei@@ a , they ended up in the Canadian amb@@ assador &apos;s residence .
The CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant cover story - they left on Canadian pas@@ sports as members of a film crew , who were surve@@ ying locations for a sci@@ -@@ fi block@@ bu@@ ster .
A combination of gen@@ res
The plan , conceived by &quot; ex@@ fil@@ tration &quot; expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hollywood .
For the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , and the fic@@ ti@@ tious production company had a real office .
The details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of Tony Men@@ dez .
Aff@@ le@@ ck &apos;s film is a pec@@ uli@@ ar mix of gen@@ res .
On one hand , there is a realistic inci@@ sive political thri@@ ller , and at the same time a &quot; cap@@ er movie , &quot; with small vic@@ tories and dou@@ ble@@ -@@ crossing - another example would be Ocean &apos;s Ele@@ ven .
The mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side , sharp docum@@ ent@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ style sequ@@ ences Teh@@ ran ( the title sequence shows i@@ con@@ ic photos from news of the time , relating to the the same events portra@@ yed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
On the other hand , ligh@@ ter sections from Hollywood , lac@@ ed with ir@@ ony and a little exag@@ ger@@ ation .
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corrid@@ ors , over the phone ...
Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck has managed to re@@ start his career in extraordinary style .
The deri@@ ded actor has has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ir@@ onic comments .
Ar@@ go is his third big@@ -@@ screen movie , following his dark crime movie G@@ one Baby G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thri@@ ller The Town ( 2010 ) .
It is to also Aff@@ le@@ ck &apos;s first picture , which does not take place in the director &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s hom@@ et@@ own of Boston .
atmosp@@ her@@ ic feel in different is one of the characteristics , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards .
Aff@@ le@@ ck shows it in Ar@@ go , where Teh@@ ran is &quot; featured &quot; by Canada it .
The best scenes of the film take take place in the streets , , , , in the the the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the si@@ ege on the emb@@ assy is impres@@ sively lu@@ ci@@ d , creating at at at at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come floo@@ ding in , as history suddenly takes turn .
A similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ le@@ ck and his team in the fic@@ ti@@ tious scenes ( the fa@@ ke staff at the the the the Teh@@ ran ba@@ za@@ ar ) ) ) .
To@@ o much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not many n@@ ail@@ -@@ bit@@ ing scenes for the film .
What little there is , is worked well , with some occa@@ sional em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ments to reality - these do not all off so eleg@@ antly ( the the , where a lo@@ oming crisis is aver@@ ted at I Teh@@ ran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a ch@@ ase on the run@@ way seems quite far@@ -@@ fet@@ ched ) .
Ar@@ go &apos;s weakness is its diver@@ gence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places .
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Goo@@ d@@ man play their roles as the Hollywood assi@@ stants with great charm ; their characters deserve more room , and are the not by far far far the only ones in this film .
Aff@@ le@@ ck &apos;s film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film film film , which can be wat@@ ched with reasonable interest , its production and retro@@ -@@ style are ev@@ oc@@ ative of thri@@ ll@@ ers from the 70 &apos;s .
It does not really cap@@ tiv@@ ate .
As a remin@@ der of history &apos;s particular ways and a testim@@ ony to how exag@@ ger@@ ated the views are on the all@@ -@@ powerful all@@ -@@ controlling secret services , this will do .
Rules for blo@@ wing up bal@@ lo@@ ons , for ban@@ anas and a cir@@ cus
The www.@@ ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .com server , which issues a po@@ ll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for &quot; the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . &quot;
&quot; We were promp@@ ted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a quota of women at management level of Europe &apos;s largest companies , &quot; Patri@@ k Nach@@ er , the po@@ ll &apos;s organis@@ er , told Pra@@ vo
Among the latest nom@@ inated absur@@ di@@ ties , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to uni@@ fy insurance premi@@ ums for men and women .
Until Until Until now , women were fav@@ oured in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower risk for insur@@ ers .
&quot; Other un@@ belie@@ vable ideas from for the EU can be nom@@ inated by anyone until the of the year .
The actual voting will then take place until end of February February February February 2013 , &quot; informed Nach@@ er .
Among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bio@@ -@@ ingredients to fuel , which consequently har@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable mer@@ cury ther@@ mom@@ eters just because they contain a a a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chi@@ cken c@@ ages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
The ban on the use of the term &quot; sp@@ read@@ able but@@ ter &quot; and the withdrawal of classic light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under criticism .
First rate ban@@ anas are to measure 14 cen@@ timet@@ res
The Union &apos;s machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lob@@ b@@ ying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states &apos; interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being v@@ eto@@ ed ) .
The lobby &apos;s were , for example , that ban@@ anas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and &quot; an@@ om@@ al@@ ous cur@@ v@@ ature . &quot;
The Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmon@@ ising existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
Nor@@ ms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been in sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the The food waste caused by the existing directives .
One possible possible possible pri@@ ze@@ -@@ winner in the po@@ ll may be the the the last year &apos;s EU regulation according to which inf@@ lat@@ able bal@@ lo@@ ons must be sold with warning that children under 8 years of age may not infl@@ ate them without par@@ ental supervision .
Here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , bal@@ lo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ oc@@ ation .
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age age using party blo@@ wers .
St@@ range ideas are conceived at home too
Fair@@ ly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece , and instead the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m F@@ Y@@ ROM ( For@@ mer Yugosla@@ v Republic of Macedonia ) should be used .
The Ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ .com server in collaboration with the Liberal Econom@@ ist Association , La@@ isse@@ z F@@ aire also nom@@ inated , aside from the af@@ ore@@ mentioned absur@@ di@@ ties for example the Union &apos;s regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
The EU stipul@@ ated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
The Czech Republic there@@ after exceeded , for instance , the permitted volume of mus@@ h@@ room pre@@ serves , which incurred a high penalty .
The po@@ ll &apos;s organis@@ ers were also also also also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of al@@ loc@@ ating funding for a request for funding .
These ideas did not come from , however , but from Prague .
&quot; We are han@@ dic@@ apped because we do not have the sea .
We are asking the European Union for a refund , declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn , J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Pal@@ as ( C@@ SS@@ D ) .
His argument was that there had been a good harv@@ est of cere@@ als , and due to the so@@ -@@ called bu@@ y@@ -@@ out interventions , the &apos;s ware@@ houses were full and were forced to export .
The Czech Republic Republic Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of of of of millions of Euros .
The European Commission finally met the CR hal@@ f@@ way by organising a tender for the purchase of cere@@ als from countries that do not have access to the sea .
Fund@@ ing to subsidi@@ se funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development &apos;s minister , P@@ av@@ el N@@ em@@ ec ( US@@ -@@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
EU : B@@ iz@@ ar@@ re legislation is the exception
Regul@@ ations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU &apos;s efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
A more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
E@@ motions fl@@ are among Cz@@ ech@@ s when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it not always succeed .
The Cz@@ ech@@ s fought for six years with the Germans and Austri@@ ans to protect the labelling of their Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ cke t@@ var@@ u@@ z@@ ky , however the tu@@ z@@ em@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be ren@@ amed tu@@ z@@ em@@ ak by the manufacturers .
The app@@ ell@@ ation of rum can only be given products di@@ still@@ ed from cane sugar , and not sugar be@@ et .
Carl@@ s@@ bad w@@ af@@ ers , Po@@ ho@@ reli@@ cky and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c hops have been added to the official list of registered products of EU , alongside the wor@@ ld@@ -@@ renowned f@@ eta cheese and g@@ org@@ on@@ z@@ ola , German mar@@ zip@@ an from Lu@@ beck and Par@@ ma ham .
The EU &apos;s stam@@ p of protection can also be prou@@ dly shown on Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce g@@ inger@@ bread and H@@ ori@@ cky tu@@ bes .
People want me to save the re@@ public , but am an am@@ ateur , says Ok@@ am@@ ura
Sen@@ ator , does a person decide they want to run for President ?
This is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president .
everything everything in our country worked without , then I would not be running for any post . as
I cannot watch any longer the country having been rob@@ bed over the past twenty years , th@@ iev@@ es ro@@ aming about there and people &apos;s taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politi@@ cian .
When I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
Since I have already turned for@@ ty , and I an independent non@@ -@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for sen@@ ator or president .
You have already reached the Sen@@ ate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle .
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Sen@@ ate &apos;s elections .
Later , I added that if I I I I were elected as sen@@ ator , I would be standing for president .
My goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised .
Therefore , I need the greatest influence , and the strongest mandate possible
trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pu@@ b or at the television , but that we tra@@ mp@@ le anyone , who wants to try to change things .
Media add to this , misleading the public , and mist@@ aking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
For example , I was alle@@ ge@@ dly bri@@ bing re@@ por@@ ters , I was alle@@ ge@@ dly an advis@@ or of J@@ ir@@ i Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k .
Let &apos;s talk about your vision .
You set out on your castle si@@ ege with thesis on the material and criminal criminal criminal criminal responsibilities of politics , and a retro@@ active financial dis@@ closure of assets over twenty . . . .
You need to change change the law for this .
As president , though , you do not have have have have this power , and only the Sen@@ ate as a whole may propose laws .
How are you going to solve ?
When I lob@@ bi@@ ed , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
The problem is political squ@@ ab@@ b@@ ling - when someone comes with a good idea from the for left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing for the public .
As an independent non@@ -@@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
The advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hol@@ ing or do@@ g@@ mas I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
Do you see as a person from the the the right , or the left ?
From the view@@ point , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
For me , it does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
The important part for me is moving forward .
It is not about whether someone is from the or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if if they are put forward by the K@@ SC@@ M or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
You get an@@ gr@@ y when someone calls you a pop@@ u@@ list .
Are not confir@@ ming this with what you have stated
When you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal vision
try to come close to it .
Some may call it populi@@ sm , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slo@@ gan@@ s .
You will not last long in politics with that .
Or do believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to convince politicians , re@@ por@@ ters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
If I were elected president , would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil serv@@ ants judges , and the Att@@ or@@ ney General .
And , as case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
Take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
I will say frank@@ ly that am an am@@ ateur , I not a geni@@ us or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and and and vision .
I have just started out in politics , I am looking for a majority support for agenda .
I will try to make things , progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
It sounds a little like Ok@@ am@@ ura is trying to save the the the the Czech Republic .
I am no sa@@ vi@@ our . . . .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate .
I went to Radi@@ m Jan@@ cur@@ a , who dec@@ lined due to his work@@ load .
So I , at least , support investig@@ ative journalist , Jan@@ a Lor@@ en@@ co@@ va , who un@@ covered frau@@ dul@@ ent activity with heating oil .
I put myself The forward , because people are really dis@@ cont@@ ented , but now I have my doubts doubts doubts doubts .
Six@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted voted for leaders of the establishment .
In the sen@@ ate , there are only two independ@@ ents , including me .
People have voted for a sen@@ ate that will will make it difficult to enforce changes .
Nonetheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of may@@ ors or regional council pre@@ sidents .
Are you considering having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to verify that every member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
You have no ?
You are talking about financial dis@@ clo@@ sures , but what is y@@ ours like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
In Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an apartment worth ten million , another apartment worth eight million , an art@@ work collection worth around ten million , an A@@ ston Martin worth 3.5 million , a S@@ ko@@ da Super@@ b a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the A@@ ston Martin , the way , it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James B@@ ond , who dro@@ ve the car , was gall@@ ant with women also fought against evil and vil@@ la@@ iny .
You drive an A@@ ston Martin , have for assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign
You say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
This does not insp@@ ire much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
Should I out a loan ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign .
The The The The fact that I do not have any spons@@ ors is evidence that there is no real interest my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator .
However , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son &apos;s English The school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
If I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
Di@@ d you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
This depends on the rate of pay
I promised , my activities have been partially reduced .
example , my dep@@ uty is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring .
People would like me to be a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an , who sa@@ ves the Republic Republic .
But I must must must also off something .
As a business@@ man , what would you usually make to monthly ?
Two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do .
And if I became president , then I would end my business activity .
The full interview can read in Saturday &apos;s issue of Pra@@ vo .
The M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architects prove that true advent@@ ures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse and the recently er@@ ected Bü@@ cher@@ berg ( literally &quot; book mountain &quot; ) - 2 photos
&quot; I think the building is fun , looks fut@@ ur@@ istic and ultimately provides something interesting interesting interesting to look at , &quot; said Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig , a pas@@ ser@@ -@@ by at road@@ -@@ side .
And Stefan Sper@@ mon , IT techni@@ cian in a major firm based nearby comm@@ ented : &quot; It &apos;s definitely a thing of beauty , the building . &quot;
However , I do wonder why people people people would need another in this day and age .
Everyone has the Internet , an i@@ Pad and e@@ Books .
No@@ -@@ one goes into one of these ol@@ d@@ -@@ style libraries volunt@@ arily nowadays , or am I wrong ?
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , a sle@@ ep@@ y town outside the g@@ ates of Rotterdam , which barely mer@@ its a visit , is a special record@@ -@@ holder .
The 8@@ 0,@@ 000@@ -@@ resident municipality has the lowest liter@@ acy rate in the whole of the Netherlands .
In to counter@@ act this as@@ in@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recre@@ ate the seven seven seven fic@@ ti@@ tious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete mini@@ atures .
The success of the education offensive was limited .
And so the city fa@@ thers acknowledged that there was one way to become with master over the statistics : a library had to be built !
Win@@ y Ma@@ as of the Rotter@@ dam@@ -@@ based architectural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , master of au@@ d@@ acious bar char@@ ts and producer of hum@@ orous and often cy@@ n@@ ical buildings , took the project on with his custom@@ ary com@@ posure , and turned up at the competitive in 2003 with five books under his arm and and and a gr@@ in on his face .
And with the jud@@ ging panel still looking at him with be@@ wil@@ der@@ ment , shr@@ ug@@ ging their shoul@@ ders , the imper@@ tin@@ ent Ma@@ as st@@ ack@@ ed his chosen pro@@ ps by order of size to form a py@@ ra@@ mid and rounded off his presentation - now su@@ itably backed up with action - with the words : &quot; De@@ ar M@@ unicip@@ ality ! &quot;
So this is my suggestion for the Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse Book Mountain - for the so@@ -@@ called Bo@@ ek@@ en@@ berg !
N@@ ine years , the 30@@ -@@ milli@@ on@@ -@@ euro mountain has been li@@ fted up .
It is is is is part of a re@@ vit@@ alisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a super@@ market , , a post office and a small number of adjacent we apartment buildings and terra@@ ced houses , with a total of 50 d@@ well@@ ings .
At the beginning of November , the Bü@@ cher@@ berg was awarded second place in the &quot; Best Library of NL 2012 &quot; competition .
In addition , the project is also nom@@ inated for the Dutch National W@@ ood Award .
Thus the fac@@ eless small@@ -@@ town ret@@ ort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post@@ -@@ modern pedestrian area and a stun@@ n@@ ingly ug@@ ly town hall , behind whose white fac@@ ades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bol@@ stered by a piece of contemporary architecture .
First and foremost , however , Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse now has its first public cultural building the history of its existence .
The long journey to the book
The impression : the El@@ dor@@ ado of books bene@@ ath a cheese d@@ ome .
There is in fact a lift that clim@@ bs through the centre of the mountain massi@@ f , however , the true true true true jo@@ ys of space and literature are revealed when sc@@ aling the to@@ po@@ graphy on foot .
The interior space , gla@@ zed throughout throughout throughout throughout , is bright and open , the fi@@ red clin@@ ker floors and the elegant street lamp@@ s speak the un@@ mistak@@ able language of a public town square .
The urban ambi@@ ance is perfect .
You are already on the lo@@ ok@@ out for a park ben@@ ch , a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
And everywhere there are books , books , books .
&quot; Nor@@ m@@ ally book shel@@ ves run along the fac@@ ade , and in the centre there is a large , , , dark space , which is usually un@@ pleasant and im@@ personal , &quot; says Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
We turned the classical spati@@ al configuration its head and turned the reading area inside out .
The interior of the Bü@@ cher@@ berg is cle@@ ver@@ ly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet library , a ch@@ ess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room .
One particularly special feature are the black book shel@@ ves , which simultaneously act as wall cl@@ adding , par@@ ap@@ ets and rail@@ ings for the sta@@ ir@@ way .
The , feel and sc@@ ent are foreign .
Even die@@ -@@ hard architects and and construction engineers sha@@ ke their heads at the unknown construction materials .
&quot; Here we wanted to work with recy@@ cl@@ able materials , &quot; explained J@@ oo@@ p Tro@@ ub@@ or@@ st , Project Manager for the M@@ unicip@@ ality of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , on request of the Standard .
And thus one day we st@@ umb@@ led across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fri@@ sian farm .
For many years , milli@@ met@@ re@@ -@@ thick artificial fabric has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer .
It is in@@ expensive and sa@@ ves time .
The thin textile la@@ sts for two seas@@ ons and is then dis@@ posed of as bulk waste .
For the library , the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - into four@@ -@@ cen@@ timet@@ re@@ -@@ thick boards .
Under heat and pressure , the so@@ -@@ called Land@@ bou@@ w plastic ( KL@@ P ) changes colour to a are dark , homo@@ gene@@ ous and robust material , that sm@@ ells like a mixture of new car sm@@ ell and the sm@@ ell of tra@@ iners .
After 105 steps you have reached the summit .
At the end of the 500@@ -@@ me@@ ter@@ -@@ long journey , you are rewar@@ ded in the Liter@@ ature Café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with and Dutch cro@@ qu@@ et@@ tes and pot@@ ted fic@@ us trees .
These These These provide atmosphere , but most importantly regulate the air hum@@ i@@ dity in the literary mountain . .
Don@@ ations for the new soul
&quot; You would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a show@@ case project in the area of ec@@ ology , &quot; said Tro@@ ub@@ or@@ st .
It is heated and cool@@ ed using geo@@ thermal heat .
Although the Bü@@ cher@@ berg has a with glass cover , the sun only sh@@ ines only briefly into the interior , even on sunny days .
The broad , lam@@ inated wood glu@@ e be@@ ams positioned at ri@@ ght@@ -@@ ang@@ les to the glass fac@@ ade , provide sha@@ de and absor@@ b the majority of the sun@@ light .
The indoor temperature is very pleasant .
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic ro@@ ller blin@@ ds .
Stefan Sper@@ mon , initially a scep@@ tic of the IT sector , has already vent@@ ured into the new library .
Lis@@ ette Ver@@ ha@@ ig has also visited already .
So too has T@@ CM@@ -@@ teacher , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia Bo@@ garde , who even refers to the Bo@@ ek@@ en@@ berg Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse &apos;s as &quot; long over@@ due soul . &quot;
The reason : At the inau@@ gu@@ ration just a few weeks ago , every citizen was invited to don@@ ate a book from his / her personal collection .
This was , for the time being , to fill the optical in the not yet fully sto@@ cked library - currently there are 70@@ ,000 items .
The concept has been a success .
The shel@@ ves are full to capacity .
&quot; Nothing is worse than a hal@@ f@@ -@@ empty library , &quot; said architect Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
&quot; I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resident now has a certain certain bond with this new building .
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building .
Even if it &apos;s just for decoration .
As such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in ma@@ stering the master discipline that specialist jar@@ gon refers to as the formation of identity .
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ isse has written literary history .
However young and un@@ educated it may be be .
This is ultimately a starting point for identity .
Sz@@ ab@@ o : &quot; Germans must play a greater with role &quot;
In the on the incorpor@@ ation of Palestine , Germany abstained from voting .
According to Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o , Exper@@ t in US@@ -@@ European relations , , in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
Deutsche Welle : At the beginning of of of of the week , had initially sign@@ alled that it vote against the Palestinians &apos; application for ob@@ server status within the United Nations .
, Berlin subsequently abstained from voting .
Why ?
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in with Gaza .
Now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany be cau@@ tious .
At the same time , however , I do not believe that that that that it supports the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit albeit albeit without being too critical of Israel .
During the u@@ pris@@ ing in Libya in March 2011 , Germany likewise abstained from voting when it came to establishing for a no@@ -@@ fly zone .
This was ultimately implemented by NATO .
Does Germany find it difficult to a clear position when it comes comes comes comes to important international affairs ?
Yes , it does .
That is because it has just re@@ organised its foreign policy , indeed away a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy .
This situation is ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardis@@ ed policy .
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fron@@ ts .
is expected be of of them that they play a more independent role , yet is something that they are not accu@@ st@@ omed to
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a &quot; more normal &quot; foreign policy .
A foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain .
So what specifically does a &quot; normal &quot; foreign policy ent@@ ail , from a German perspective ?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , on China or the Near Near East .
Germany &apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests interests interests interests .
Have economic interests had influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN ?
On the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East , and particularly in the Gulf States .
Therefore it must be careful not to aff@@ ront the public , but also the elite in the Ara@@ bic countries .
In any case , this plays a role .
However , I w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to as@@ cri@@ be too much weight to this . This not an entirely one@@ -@@ sided relationship .
Nonetheless , it does play an important role in Germany &apos;s considerations .
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by absta@@ ining to vote on important , such as the vote on Palestine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position prev@@ ails .
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fra@@ c@@ ture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya .
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect
After all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously an international player and that its interests be considered .
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative .
The USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a ve@@ to .
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ?
Due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always existed .
I think that secre@@ tly , the government government government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation .
However , due to the political situation here the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly .
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear .
If you look at the relations between Obama and and Prime Minister Net@@ an@@ jah@@ u , Obama is really not quite so so enth@@ used by Net@@ an@@ jah@@ u &apos;s policies .
Does Germany find it difficult to re@@ conci@@ le its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans .
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardis@@ ed European policy , which is currently not the .
Thus they are are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
This is precisely what what they are doing with the Euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in ur@@ ging Europe towards a standardis@@ ed European position .
This is , of course no the simple The task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
This has always been a sensitive subject subject subject .
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
Does Germany view itself playing the role role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ? ? ?
Germany is still not used to to it , the country continues be un@@ comfortable and , for obvious reasons reasons , still finds it difficult to play play play play a more prominent role
If we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assumes a more prominent the role , various anti@@ -@@ German feelings become apparent .
This does not make matters simple for the Germans .
This is actually the same old problem one does not want to be surrounded by hosti@@ le countries .
From this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA .
It . must be recep@@ tive to most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and is not easy .
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually dimin@@ ishing , yet the EU EU EU is currently not feeling this vacuum , so who is the this gap ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
Even if they do not like it , even if it is un@@ comfortable and makes them even more un@@ popular - c &apos;@@ est la vie !

&quot; Brand protection &quot; in China : When Pum@@ a and Ar@@ man@@ i suddenly become Chinese
Ar@@ man@@ i is a wor@@ ld@@ -@@ famous brand , Polo R@@ al@@ ph Lau@@ ren likewise .
However , what is Ar@@ man@@ i Polo ?
Beh@@ ind this name hi@@ des a fully officially registered brand in China , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies .
Nonetheless Nonetheless Nonetheless Nonetheless , it is enjoying protection , provided the actual cre@@ ators of the names do not su@@ e .
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights .
&quot; It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , &quot; said Thomas P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch , lawyer within the Ta@@ yl@@ or W@@ essing law firm , who speciali@@ ses in to copyright infringement in the Far East .
Every week a new case lands on my desk .
All All All the copy@@ c@@ ats require are a few additional in order that they can register their brands .
Thus Gu@@ cc@@ i simply becomes Lu@@ -@@ Gu@@ cc@@ i , Pra@@ da@@ -@@ K@@ ny is registered in place of Pra@@ da . of
German companies are also &apos; legally &apos; cop@@ ied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting app@@ arel , Pum@@ a .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch opens a file containing regi@@ strations with the trademark office in in Peking .
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copy@@ righ@@ ted the brand name Z@@ eg@@ na DF Pum@@ a there , an ali@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashion re@@ ta@@ iler Er@@ men@@ eg@@ il@@ do Z@@ eg@@ na .
The fact that the Chinese are world champ@@ ions in copying and inf@@ ring@@ ing on intellectual property is well@@ -@@ known .
In the major cities there are multi@@ -@@ level department stores that sell counter@@ f@@ eit goods almost exclusively . .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch &apos;s cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be we granted the to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere .
The it Chinese call this &quot; B@@ ang M@@ ing@@ pa@@ i , &quot; a passenger brand .
The word is based on &quot; B@@ ang D@@ aku@@ an . &quot;
This refers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men .
The Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any w@@ ron@@ g@@ doing .
&quot; This har@@ ms business and we must fight against it , &quot; challenges P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
&quot; The brand is water@@ ed down , its uniqu@@ eness dis@@ appears - the image damage is enormous . &quot;
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flag@@ ship products .
According to information from market research company CL@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion the euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fastest growing .
However , the dele@@ tion of du@@ bi@@ ous entries in the trademark regi@@ stry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty p@@ enny .
The process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch reports of instances whereby the court dis@@ mis@@ ses cases , because after a long period of The time , the name to which the objec@@ tion is being raised has become a &quot; market reality . &quot;
If the compla@@ in@@ ant is un@@ lucky , he may even have to pay the pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist money for having inf@@ ring@@ ed on his trademark in China , said P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
Sometimes the law of the jung@@ le prev@@ ails here .
Fam@@ ous cases also relate to graphic elements .
In 2009 , Daim@@ ler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer P@@ utz@@ meister .
Even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an em@@ ble@@ m that res@@ embles the Mercedes star .
Vol@@ vo@@ -@@ purchaser Ge@@ ely originally used blue and white logo that res@@ emb@@ led the BMW logo ; the dispute was arbit@@ rated and Ge@@ ely to change it .
Fas@@ hion house Lac@@ o@@ ste lost a suit China against copy@@ c@@ ats from Hong Kong and Singapore , who were using the famous cro@@ codi@@ le looking in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are un@@ aware of any w@@ ron@@ g@@ doing .
The C@@ T@@ M@@ O trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks in 2010 due to to to limited staff@@ ing and equipment .
In the past year , however , things things things things re@@ porte@@ dly &quot; returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . &quot;
Thus the stock of un@@ processed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent .
Almost 5@@ 7@@ ,000 such c@@ ased were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous previous previous previous year .
Nonetheless , there are still 8@@ 1,@@ 500 appe@@ als waiting to be resolved in the office .
To remedy this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing .
In the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for for trademark protection were submitted to the C@@ T@@ M@@ O , almost one third more than in 2010 .
This is a record and means that China , for for for tent@@ h time in succ@@ ession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
The same applies for the invent@@ ory of valid trademarks , tot@@ alling 5.@@ 5 million in number .
In 2011 , 1.@@ 8 billion y@@ uan in fees were received .
P@@ ut simply , this means that each application with costs on average 1,@@ 2@@ 80 y@@ uan , or 160 euros .
To appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German business , Freu@@ den@@ berg .
For more than seven years , the group has been con@@ testing against a Chinese pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ist .
The Germans did in fact manage to ex@@ pose the company &apos;s illegal manufacturing of cop@@ ied motor vehicle parts .
However , the copy@@ cat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freu@@ den@@ berg brand .
This is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in Germany , said Han@@ no W@@ entz@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Freu@@ den@@ berg Chem@@ ical Speci@@ alities in Munich .
The C@@ T@@ M@@ O trademark office then also dis@@ missed the Mun@@ ich@@ -@@ based company &apos;s appeal .
In the next two instances , Freu@@ den@@ berg was proven right , however the op@@ posing party continues to contest the matter matter matter matter to this day .
You have to pay pay pay pay extremely as careful attention .
The matter is now pending before the the the Supreme Court .
W@@ entz@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and pra@@ ises the profession@@ alism of the courts .
However , he also says : &quot; The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and ner@@ ves . &quot;
The internal costs can barely calculated , the company archive even had to look through cent@@ ur@@ y@@ -@@ old records in order to provide proof .
Five Five Five years ago Freu@@ den@@ berg un@@ successfully offered the op@@ posing party a &quot; high six@@ -@@ figure sum in the euros &quot; as settlement .
&quot; This shows how how how much this is worth to us , &quot; says W@@ entz@@ ler .
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to sp@@ illing over , back into Europe .
Partic@@ ularly if im@@ it@@ ators secure un@@ protected brand names there .
For example , a Chinese manufacturer wanted to the register the Freu@@ den@@ berg label for shoes and leather in Germany .
This is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed prevent the registration .
&quot; You have to pay extremely careful attention , &quot; says W@@ entz@@ ler .
Both he and P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China .
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register &quot; everything &quot; that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , &quot; said W@@ entz@@ ler .
Otherwise the costs can be much more expensive than the the registration fee .
In actual fact : if Freu@@ den@@ berg were to loo@@ se at the final hur@@ dle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the op@@ posing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained W@@ entz@@ ler .
Or altern@@ atively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector . for
World AIDS day : St@@ om@@ p , sing , help
In Heidelberg , the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir is re@@ hear@@ sing - and in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and , AIDS orph@@ ans are delighted .
The history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8,@@ 7@@ 33 kilometres .
First of all , the stamp@@ ing : co@@ w@@ boy bo@@ ots , bas@@ ketball shoes , ladies &apos; pum@@ ps and men &apos;s lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the par@@ quet floor , and quickly do just that .
O@@ ne@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ -@@ thre@@ e@@ -@@ four .
Only then do the voices of of of the sing@@ ers slowly s@@ well - alto , bass , ten@@ or and s@@ op@@ ran@@ o sur@@ ge , be@@ gui@@ le and ha@@ unt .
And F@@ ie@@ te Hop@@ f , the 29@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old conductor , almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings ens@@ emble together with his smooth , yet wild gest@@ ures .
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psych@@ ology in Heidelberg the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ i Cho@@ ir are practi@@ sing new song .
The fifteen sing@@ ers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human geneti@@ ci@@ sts to the maintenance man .
&quot; O@@ m &apos;@@ O@@ ban@@ i &quot; is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : we Zul@@ u , which is spoken by el@@ even million people in South Africa , Bot@@ s@@ wan@@ a , Les@@ oth@@ o , Mal@@ aw@@ i , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and in in in in parts of S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and .
Hel@@ ping others to help themselves
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world , as according to estim@@ ations of Un@@ ai@@ ds , the United Nations &apos; programme to battle AIDS .
Of these , 2@@ 3.5 million live in South Africa .
In S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and , there are 24@@ 5@@ ,000 AIDS orph@@ ans .
Meanwhile , more than 40 of the population a are HIV positive .
The Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found spons@@ ors in Germany for 180 AIDS orph@@ ans in the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i .
70 of these attend a secondary secondary school .
For 15 or 20 per month , you can become a spons@@ or .
This guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and warm meal each day in the Go@@ go Centre .
In Zul@@ u , I@@ mb@@ ong@@ i means stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller or wor@@ shi@@ pper .
In this region , no@@ -@@ one can speak the B@@ ant@@ u flu@@ ently , but they can sing it .
For almost ten years the cho@@ ir has been practi@@ sing in this foreign , &apos; soft &apos; language , and now and then then then then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa .
For an 8,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3@@ -@@ kilomet@@ re flight away from Heidelberg , in the north west of the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i which reli@@ es on the vocal power of the German cho@@ ir .
For@@ ty percent in are are are are infected .
Around 2@@ ,000 people live there , some still in simple mu@@ d and stra@@ w hu@@ ts , and the majority of them are children .
More than 300 of them no longer have parents , , as they succ@@ um@@ bed to the virus .
In E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i you get a small fo@@ res@@ ha@@ dow of the illness from which all of S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and is suffering : according to Un@@ ic@@ ef , the has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expec@@ tan@@ cy in the world .
Cir@@ cum@@ ci@@ sion , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half , is barely practi@@ sed by the population .
More than for@@ ty percent of people in the S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and carry the imm@@ un@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus , and dying in you mid@@ -@@ thir@@ ties is by no means rare .
On a group trip to Africa early 2005 , the Cho@@ ir visited the village , but first and foremost , the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in par@@ ental care but in practically everything else as well : food , clothing , education .
Without a school leaving certificate , are barely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country .
Initi@@ ally it was the private commitment of in to send a child school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros euros per year .
However , just one year later , the cho@@ ir established the &quot; Vo@@ ices for Africa &quot; Association , which since then has been after the AIDS orph@@ ans in E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i at an almost professional level .
F@@ acts on sex@@ ually transmitted infec@@ tions .
What are the most important sex@@ ually transmitted diseases ?
B@@ ac@@ ter@@ ial ST@@ Is include s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea .
Common vi@@ ral ST@@ Is are HIV , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses , her@@ pes gen@@ itali@@ s and h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis .
Cra@@ bs and sc@@ ab@@ ies belong among the par@@ asi@@ tic ST@@ Is .
Who are the main affected groups ?
S@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis and gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea occur primarily in men have inter@@ course with other men .
The Robert K@@ och Institute understands that at least four in five of all s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual between men .
Among hetero@@ sexual adults , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infec@@ tions , tri@@ ch@@ om@@ oni@@ asis candi@@ di@@ asis ( f@@ ung@@ al ) , gon@@ or@@ r@@ ho@@ ea and human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are frequently frequently frequently occurring sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
The spread of HIV among hetero@@ sexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV are found in this group .
Among young people , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia infec@@ tions are much more common than in other population groups .
According to European surve@@ ys , three quarters of all infec@@ tions affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
In this country , human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses are also frequently found in young people .
How has the number of infec@@ tions developed ?
Not all sex@@ ually transmitted diseases are noti@@ fiable .
According to to to the Robert K@@ och Institute , the of s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis infec@@ tions has more than doub@@ led from 1,@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 , , , to 3,@@ 6@@ 98 in 2011 .
The number of newly contrac@@ ted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 .
In 2011 there were around 2,@@ 700 cases .
This is around one tent@@ h fewer than the previous year .
Which symptoms indicate a sex@@ ually transmitted ?
The infec@@ tious diseases can cause ul@@ c@@ ers in the gen@@ ital area , dis@@ comfort when ur@@ in@@ ating , discharge , lower ab@@ domin@@ al pain and bli@@ sters or war@@ ts .
However , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus remaining un@@ detected .
How can you protect yourself ?
Con@@ d@@ oms can reduce the risk of contrac@@ tion , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
This is because occasionally , the pa@@ tho@@ gens of sex@@ ually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via sme@@ ar infec@@ tions and close bo@@ di@@ ly contact .
Therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners under@@ go regular exam@@ inations .
If diagno@@ sed early , the majority of ST@@ Is can be cu@@ red and long@@ -@@ term consequences avoided .
Through spon@@ sor@@ ships don@@ ations and by no means least the funds that the cho@@ ir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
&quot; In total , we have already sent around 200@@ ,000 euros to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , &quot; said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , Chair@@ person of the association .
In the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini , a sel@@ f@@ -@@ assured and asser@@ tive woman , man@@ ages the money from Germany .
She makes sure that the orph@@ ans have good accommodation , example with one of their grand@@ mothers .
The Go@@ gos , as the old ladies are called in Zul@@ u , are the pillars of the village .
of them have up to 14 orph@@ ans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes pun@@ c@@ tually every day , in their school uni@@ forms .
Anyone who doesn &apos;t have anyone , arri@@ ves at the shel@@ ter with K@@ han@@ y@@ isi@@ le , a single woman who ear@@ ns the same sal@@ ary from the association association association association as the two coo@@ ks who co@@ ok for more than 200 hung@@ ry children every day .
In addition , &quot; Vo@@ ices for Africa &quot; has established a se@@ wing school , built two two two chi@@ cken co@@ ops and , together with the American health organisation , P@@ SI , organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV .
This is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wra@@ ps is if people are dead .
A king with 14 wi@@ ves
&quot; AIDS is an an an absolute t@@ abo@@ o subject , &quot; An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , &quot; because it is associated with sexu@@ ality . &quot;
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wi@@ ves .
The last absolute mon@@ arch of of sub@@ -@@ Sah@@ aran Africa , King M@@ s@@ wat@@ i III . , is known for his his his his excessive lifestyle
Poly@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy .
Among other factors , the that the HIV has has has has spread spread spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attri@@ buted to this officially sanc@@ tioned lifestyle .
Another factor factor is the large number of m@@ igrant workers of who carry the virus across the country .
There are free con@@ d@@ oms on every corner , said An@@ nette L@@ enn@@ art@@ z , &quot; but they are hardly used .
The culture prescri@@ bes otherwise - fl@@ es@@ h to fl@@ es@@ h . &quot;
In order to promote the cultural exchange , the I@@ mb@@ ong@@ i cho@@ ir tra@@ vels through Africa every two or three years and s@@ ings songs of mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y , fighting spirit , confidence and and and black sel@@ f@@ -@@ est@@ e@@ em , which many from from the southern tip tip tip of the black continent still know from the times of apar@@ thei@@ d .
A bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of of of of recognition brings not only mor@@ ale and joy , but some gri@@ m@@ -@@ faced border soldiers even even shed a few te@@ ars .
The journey always leads to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , where the sing@@ ers visit their spons@@ or children .
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it more well@@ -@@ known in valley of E@@ zu@@ l@@ wen@@ i River . . . .
&quot; Go to E@@ sit@@ jen@@ i , that that that &apos;s where the light is , &quot; say say say the people there .
And if you make the 8,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3@@ -@@ kilomet@@ re flight back to Heidelberg , to visit the st@@ omp@@ ing sing@@ ers in their re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room , you &apos;ll see that the light is there too .
Messenger : N@@ ASA dis@@ covers ice on Mer@@ cury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the Mer@@ cury .
It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick .
The US space agency , N@@ ASA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury .
Although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in , specialist magazine &quot; Science . &quot;
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that be lies permanently in shadow .
This is thought to be at east 30 cen@@ timet@@ res and perhaps up to 20 metres thick .
The water pre@@ sum@@ ably came from com@@ ets or perhaps also ast@@ ero@@ ids that imp@@ acted with Mer@@ cury .
However , no@@ -@@ one is linking the discovery of with the existence of life on the planet , said Chief Scienti@@ st the Messenger probe , S@@ ean Sol@@ om@@ on .
The temperature on Mer@@ cury can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us .

Our view of the universe : the most important tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es
The tel@@ es@@ cope is thought to have we been inv@@ ented in 16@@ 08 by Hans Li@@ p@@ per@@ h@@ ey - even before Galileo Galile@@ i used the device to the stars one year later .
Since then , the mir@@ rors optical tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insi@@ ghts that they provide increasingly profound .
For a period of 30 years , namely from 19@@ 47 until 1975 , the H@@ ale tel@@ es@@ cope in the the the the Pal@@ om@@ ar Ob@@ servatory near San Di@@ ego was the largest tel@@ es@@ cope in the world .
The mirror , shown in the image , had a diameter of five metres .
Ari@@ zona , USA , is home to the Large B@@ ino@@ cular Tel@@ es@@ cope .
It enables views of space via two mir@@ rors , each with a diameter of 8.@@ 4 metres .
The inner work@@ ings of the Gran Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ io Can@@ ari@@ as on the Can@@ arian island La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.@@ 4 metres .
The mirror of the Southern African Large Tel@@ es@@ cope in South Africa is seg@@ mented - to reduce costs .
In spite of this it achiev@@ es a a diameter of around el@@ even metres .
disadvantage of this in@@ expensive construction method : the tel@@ es@@ cope is sec@@ u@@ rely cl@@ amp@@ ed at its angle of inc@@ lin@@ ation and its movement is therefore limited .
The Hob@@ by E@@ ber@@ ly tel@@ es@@ cope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inc@@ lin@@ ation .
What sets it apart : the high light@@ -@@ gathering capacity .
This - in spite of its compar@@ atively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world &apos;s largest reflec@@ tor tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .

Likewise to be located at the ES@@ O Ob@@ servatory in Chile , the European Extre@@ m@@ ely Large Tel@@ es@@ cope is also being planned .
Its is to span a full metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
However , images are not to be expected until 20@@ 18 at the earliest .
Until 2007 , the two K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es at the Ha@@ wai@@ ian volcan@@ o , Ma@@ una Ke@@ a , were the largest in the world .
They each have two two two mir@@ rors , each with a diameter of ten meters .
The K@@ eck Tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ una Ke@@ a Ob@@ servatory , which alongside the K@@ eck tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , can look to the heav@@ ens with the help of the Sub@@ ar@@ u tel@@ es@@ cope and the IR@@ T@@ T@@ F .
Another huge new tel@@ es@@ cope is also to be built on the Ma@@ una Ke@@ a , with a mirror diameter of thirty metres .
Here you can mar@@ vel at an artist &apos;s &apos;s impression .
However for , the most important insi@@ ghts into space are provided by the Hub@@ ble space tel@@ es@@ cope .

Since March 2009 the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ es@@ cope has been searching be for extra@@ -@@ solar plan@@ ets , especially for any that may be inhab@@ itable .

Dr@@ ink but@@ ter on on a daily basis - and live to 16@@ 8 years of age
In . Southern Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan , many people reach bi@@ b@@ lical ages .
There is even a museum of lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity .
A h@@ unt for evidence in it the country in which years old is still compar@@ atively young .
In Southern Southern Southern Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan , many reach ages that can almost be considered bi@@ b@@ lical .
There is even a museum of lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity .
A h@@ unt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still compar@@ atively young .
The journey through with the T@@ aly@@ sh Mountains can we be described as wild and romantic .
The mini@@ bus ru@@ mb@@ les over the win@@ ding streets , past den@@ sely woo@@ ded hills , ra@@ ging rivers and simple farm@@ houses .
Every@@ where is green and lush - you could be for@@ given for thinking you were in the Black Forest .
However , this is the deep south of Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan , and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away .
This is the home the of Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an people group , the T@@ aly@@ sh , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Per@@ sian and Azer@@ i and live long lives .
The final stop is L@@ eri@@ k .
The small town is bur@@ sting with over@@ power@@ ing architecture from Soviet times , which doesn &apos;t fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all .
Tou@@ rists from Europe rarely come here ; the journey from Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan &apos;s capital city , Bak@@ u , is too ar@@ du@@ ous .
It takes eight hours to travel the 3@@ 23 kilometres , as too much of the route is just a single track .
The fabulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the Cas@@ pi@@ an Sea to thank , has not yet arri@@ ves here in the province .
Yet Pil@@ ata Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ eri@@ k what it takes to be a tourist attraction are .
&quot; Bak@@ u became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision Song Con@@ test , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , &quot; said Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
She is the Director of the Museum of Lon@@ ge@@ v@@ ity , most likely the only of its kind in the world .
Here the lives of eight do@@ zen T@@ aly@@ sh from the area lived to older than 100 are documented . Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva points out a black &amp; white photo .
This here is my grand@@ father , he was 120 years old .
At the age of 13@@ 6 he fa@@ ther@@ ed another child child child child
However , , the un@@ ri@@ v@@ alled star of the museum is sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d Shi@@ r@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v who is said to have lived to 16@@ 8 years old .
However no birth certificate exists to confirm this .
And given that the longest confirmed li@@ fes@@ pan was 12@@ 2 years of age , Musli@@ mo@@ v &apos;s claim seems extremely doub@@ tful
&quot; He was born in 18@@ 05 , here in the region , and died in 1973 , &quot; explains Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
The man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have have have fa@@ ther@@ ed another daughter it at the age of 13@@ 6 .
So did Shi@@ r@@ ali Musli@@ mo@@ v mis@@ calcul@@ ate his age by a couple of decades ?
But Rem@@ br@@ andt Sch@@ olz , resear@@ cher on ageing at the Max Plan@@ ck Institute Ro@@ stock , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia .
&quot; A strik@@ ingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the H@@ un@@ za Valley in Pakistan , &quot; said Sch@@ olz , &quot; while there is also an an extremely number of very old men in Sard@@ inia . &quot;
Due to lacking documentation , however , there is no scientific of age , particularly as there are birth regi@@ sters .
Mel@@ ted but@@ ter by the glass , every day
However , , , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ eri@@ k reach a a bi@@ b@@ lical age with striking regul@@ arity .
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age .
So why so many very old people live here the south ?
The Azer@@ i travel guide F@@ ari@@ d Mu@@ gi@@ m@@ z@@ ade@@ h explains this as being due to special T@@ aly@@ sh gene@@ tics .
In contrast , Museum Director Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva believes that it is due to diet .
However the the notion that the cal@@ ori@@ e@@ -@@ rich diet of the T@@ aly@@ sh , who , bread and especially dairy products , and of whom many drink a glass of mel@@ ted but@@ ter on a daily I basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition perspective does not really seem plau@@ sible either .
Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? In C@@ en@@ gem@@ i@@ ran , a tiny settlement not far the town of L@@ eri@@ k , lives Rub@@ aba Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
At 97 years old she is still compar@@ atively young for the area .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 14@@ 3 desc@@ end@@ ants lives in a simple wooden house , which which which which is typical of the entire Caucasus region .
She si@@ ts on the floor with a but@@ ter chur@@ n , which she roll@@ s back@@ wards and for@@ wards ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
Ei@@ ght people live here under this roof , including one of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grand@@ parents for some time .
There are also two small children running around .
In the kitchen , tea is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , bul@@ ging Ar@@ ma@@ du gl@@ asses .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s white teeth stand in perfect rank file , bene@@ ath her head@@ sc@@ arf she conce@@ als long , dark bl@@ ond pla@@ its which her son prou@@ dly reveals for us .
I have always wash@@ ed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour .
&quot; I have used sh@@ am@@ po@@ o either , &quot; said Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
Mon@@ thly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever e@@ aten what she could get from her own farm - tom@@ ato@@ es , pot@@ ato@@ es , pe@@ as .
My whole life . I never once bought gro@@ c@@ eries in the super@@ market .
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army .
Th@@ ings were at their worst during the time after the Second World War .
However , everything became better when the &quot; bel@@ o@@ ved father &quot; He@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ ye@@ v took the ru@@ d@@ der .
The be propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady .
Yet the cul@@ t that revol@@ ved around the be father figure for the nation , who governed his country like a dict@@ ator practically knows no limits in Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan .
He held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the helm .
At least there is no de@@ priv@@ ation among Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan &apos;s elderly .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva receives Man@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably .
And perhaps Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s long gre@@ ying son is right : &quot; The elderly enjoy a deep respect our culture . &quot;
They live among their extended family , are loved , c@@ ared for and are happy .
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ?
The notion of &quot; human rights &quot; is om@@ it@@ ted from the constitution .
The revolution has returned to C@@ airo .
Comp@@ eting demonstrations C@@ airo reveal deep division within the country
The future constitution based based on Sh@@ aria law is fi@@ erc@@ ely disp@@ uted .
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emo@@ tion .
We must make the transition .
&quot; And making sure it succe@@ eds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , &quot; he said on state television .
His speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the Cop@@ tic Christians , the liber@@ als , en@@ ligh@@ tened Muslims and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts .
For all of them , until now hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly est@@ ran@@ ged in a be@@ wil@@ dered opposition , are f@@ ear@@ ful .
They are f@@ ear@@ ful of a God State on the Ni@@ le at be the mer@@ cy of the powerful Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
According to Moh@@ amed Mur@@ si , speaking almost apo@@ lo@@ ge@@ tically , he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , &quot; in order to rescue the revolution . &quot;
However , Egyp@@ ti@@ ans - the world - are not entirely sure what the 6@@ 1@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old engine@@ er who holds a Doc@@ torate from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save .
Should the judi@@ ciary be depri@@ ved of power ?
In actual fact , the 23@@ 4 articles , which have pushed through by the with Islam@@ ic@@ -@@ dominated 1@@ 10@@ -@@ person Constitu@@ ent Assembly , are in some some aspects cause for concern .
As was also the case under previous constitu@@ tions , under the ju@@ dic@@ ature is justified on the &quot; principles of Islamic law . &quot;
Yet what are &quot; &quot; &quot; principles &quot;
This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islam@@ ists will make use of the wo@@ ol@@ ly form@@ ulation and the resulting room for legal manoeu@@ vre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sh@@ aria law .
This is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting Sh@@ aria law , the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consulted , the country &apos;s most important Islamic Islamic institution , has great influence throughout the whole of Sun@@ ni Islam .
This can , but does not necessarily have have have have to mean that the cl@@ ergy will over@@ see legislation , which would result in the for de facto incap@@ ac@@ itation of the judi@@ ciary .
Much in the constitutional draft is open interpretation
Also problematic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be uph@@ eld .
During M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak &apos;s rule , these courts served to sup@@ press opposition .
Following the fall the dict@@ ator , up to 11@@ ,000 civilians were under military im@@ prison@@ ment .
to the draft , the state should also protect &quot; the true character of the Egyptian , and promote its mor@@ als and values . &quot;
From a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an un@@ clear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cin@@ em@@ atic art I and literature .
plain language , this is nothing other than c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women .
Another does prohi@@ bit the insu@@ lt or s@@ lander of the proph@@ et Moh@@ amed and his emis@@ s@@ aries .
However , what constitutes an insu@@ lt and how this should be sanc@@ tioned remains un@@ clear .
Equ@@ ally du@@ bi@@ ous is the form@@ ulation stating that &quot; insul@@ ting people &quot; is forbidden .
Is a car@@ ic@@ ature of the president sufficient , or a jo@@ ke at the expense of a jur@@ ist ?
Open to interpretation , so much in the draft submitted by Mur@@ si to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egyp@@ ti@@ ans for referendum &quot; very soon . &quot;
&quot; The revolution is back &quot;
For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islam@@ ists .
T@@ ens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square in C@@ airo , in un@@ familiar unity , and ple@@ dged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect .
&quot; The revolution is back and we are going to be vic@@ t@@ orious , &quot; said Ham@@ din Sab@@ bah@@ i , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
Nob@@ le Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Authority , Moh@@ amed El@@ -@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i that the constitutional draft belongs &quot; on the rub@@ b@@ ish tip of history . &quot;
Via SMS service Twitter , he accused Mur@@ si &apos;s follo@@ wers of wanting to lead a &quot; a coup against democracy . &quot;
&quot; , If he calls for the referendum , we will go to his palace and over@@ throw him , &quot; said said member of the opposition J@@ asser Sa@@ id .
&quot; We have not yet grown tired , the of our bro@@ thers has not yet been at@@ oned for , &quot; stated the media , quot@@ ing opposition politi@@ cian Chal@@ ed Ali .
And several judges have have sign@@ alled that they do not want to over@@ see the referendum , which would render it invali@@ d .
&quot; The Kor@@ an is our constitution &quot;
The well@@ -@@ organised Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood gathered for a counter@@ -@@ demonstration , although acting cau@@ ti@@ ously they did not choose the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square but rather a mass pra@@ yer on other side of the Ni@@ le , outside the C@@ airo University .
Many vei@@ led women and follo@@ wers of the Sal@@ af@@ is took part , sh@@ ou@@ ting out : &quot; The people demand the application of God &apos;s law &quot;
They demanded of Mur@@ si : &quot; Cle@@ an@@ se the ! &quot; and pro@@ tested : &quot; The Kor@@ an is our constitution . &quot;
A struggle for control over the symbolic T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square , where everything began , would have most likely prov@@ oked events ver@@ ging on civil war .
Quite clearly , this was Mur@@ si &apos;s follo@@ wers did not want risk .
The Muslim Bro@@ thers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
Now is the time to let the population decide at the bal@@ lot box , in which direction the country should move forward .
It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islam@@ ists &apos; draft .
&quot; The term &apos; human rights &apos; does not even appear once &quot;
Haf@@ ez Abu Sa@@ eda is fu@@ ri@@ ous about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have la@@ sted until February and should have involved all social interest groups .
The 48@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ HR ) defended the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood , when im@@ pris@@ oned in court under M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak .
Not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are indi@@ visible .
For this he was bat@@ tered , condemned and im@@ pris@@ oned .
&quot; And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , &quot; he be@@ mo@@ an@@ ed in a discussion with &quot; Welt am Sonntag . &quot;
The lawyer has re@@ signed himself to Mur@@ si extending his power to all three branches of state government .
These measures are b@@ lat@@ ant bre@@ aches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship .
&quot; Instead strengthening the civil society , the President is is is effectively sus@@ pending it it it it , &quot; compla@@ ined Sa@@ eda .
Yet without civil society organisations , a democracy cannot function .
Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is ob@@ serving the battle over the ideological direction on the Ni@@ le with a mixture of curi@@ osity and exc@@ itement .
This could come back to ha@@ unt them .

Norway &apos;s rak@@ fis@@ k : Is this the world &apos;s sm@@ elli@@ est fish ?
Norway &apos;s five million enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
Could the secret of the country &apos;s success be connected to the local appe@@ ti@@ te for some exce@@ ed@@ ingly sm@@ el@@ ly fish ?
Take a selection of over@@ -@@ ri@@ pe che@@ eses .
Place them in the midst of a pi@@ le of dirty , wet so@@ ccer kit .
Le@@ ave for a week .
Now Now you have the no@@ se@@ -@@ num@@ bing sm@@ ell of rak@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Norwe@@ gian de@@ lic@@ ac@@ ies .
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es , about three hours from Oslo .
There is snow , spectacular scenery - and that od@@ our , ever present , han@@ gs in the air .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is tro@@ ut sprin@@ kl@@ ed with salt salt salt and fer@@ mented in water for - depending on how sm@@ el@@ ly you like your fish - up to a year .
As the dark sets in and the weather weather weather weather turns cold , Norwe@@ gi@@ ans flo@@ ck to a festival here in F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es devoted to this most , well , cap@@ tiv@@ ating of foods .
&quot; You eat it raw , and then s@@ wal@@ low a of aqu@@ av@@ it , says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , ful@@ l@@ -@@ time local fire@@ figh@@ ter but also the so@@ -@@ called &quot; Rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; in charge of running the festival .
All around us people are eating little c@@ ub@@ es of the fish and kno@@ cking back quantities of drink .
&quot; Some people like the aqu@@ av@@ it more than the rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; says Hav@@ ard .
The drink can can kill the sm@@ ell .
I try a few pieces .
If you can avoid passing it under your no@@ se , it is not bad - not unlike a sli@@ ce of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , pover@@ ty@@ -@@ stri@@ cken times in in in in Norway when , pre@@ -@@ refriger@@ ation , fish was so@@ aked in air@@ tight bar@@ rel@@ s of water and salt in autumn .
Then in the dep@@ ths of winter , well and truly fer@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses kno@@ cked out alcohol - e@@ aten .
Only a generation ago , thousands of Norwe@@ gi@@ ans were to leave their country in search of work , em@@ ig@@ rating mainly to the US .
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by pl@@ enti@@ ful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
People from Sweden , the old rival rival and not so long ago far rich@@ er than Norway , stream in to work .
Rak@@ fis@@ k is seen as signi@@ fying something important , a vital if rather sm@@ el@@ ly part of Norway &apos;s past .
It is among the more expensive dishes you can buy .
But then everything is expensive - a small glass beer or a sand@@ wich kno@@ ck you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each . . . .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to to to like it that way .
People here are still lo@@ ath to mention by name Anders Anders Anders B@@ rei@@ vi@@ k , the ri@@ ght@@ -@@ wing , rac@@ ist extrem@@ ist who gun@@ ned down and killed 77 men women and children last year .
Instead , the sho@@ ot@@ ings are referred to as &quot; the July the the the 2@@ 2nd incident . &quot;
Norwe@@ gi@@ ans find it very difficult to believe in their peace@@ -@@ lo@@ ving country one of their own was capable of such brut@@ ality and murder
The growth since the early 1970s of one of the world &apos;s biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway &apos;s present@@ -@@ day wealth .
&quot; But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , &quot; says Anna our wa@@ it@@ ress , hand@@ ing round tra@@ ys of mat@@ uring rak@@ fis@@ k and , with her long bl@@ ond hair and star@@ t@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nordic well@@ -@@ being .
We are a - how you say - pru@@ dent people .
Her English , like that of most people here , is fla@@ w@@ less .
We are not very show@@ y , we do not like ost@@ entation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
When everyone else was thro@@ wing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its pur@@ se str@@ ings tigh@@ tly bound .
&quot; As As As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer it we are happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anna .
And eat rak@@ fis@@ k , &quot; she adds with a care@@ free lau@@ gh .
I stand in the snow and qu@@ eu@@ e for something to eat - I have had had enough rak@@ fis@@ k .

Mexico &apos;s En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to faces tough start
As Mexico &apos;s incoming President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to pre@@ pa@@ res to take office the BBC &apos;s Will Gran@@ t looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
Traff@@ ic in Mexico City is particularly at present .
A con@@ ge@@ sted city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been er@@ ected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
The aim , however , wasn &apos;t to stop comm@@ u@@ ters getting to work but prevent prote@@ sters from reaching parliament . . . .
On Saturday , Mexico &apos;s new president En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of on the nation .
He faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been performing well well well economically under the out@@ going administration of Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country country is we in the gri@@ p of a drug war , which has already claimed an 60@@ ,000 lives in six years .
&quot; My government has a great commitment to Mex@@ ican people to reduce the violence , &quot; Mr Mr Mr Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to US President Barack Obama the O@@ val Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
Before rub@@ bing shoul@@ ders with the US president , Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to &apos;s previous political experience was as govern@@ or of his home state , the State of Mexico .
A popul@@ ous , spra@@ w@@ ling state surrounding the , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old st@@ omp@@ ing ground .
A straight@@ forward man
In the bu@@ co@@ lic town of Valle del Bra@@ vo , for example , he is remember@@ ed f@@ ondly .
Re@@ sidents credit him with boo@@ sting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
To reach the I town you can drive along of Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to &apos;s new motor@@ ways , a improvement on the cra@@ cked and bum@@ p@@ y roads it replaced .
Pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an an an an impressive interactive museum about climate change change .
&quot; We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , &quot; says friend and political ally Gabri@@ el Ol@@ ver@@ a Her@@ nan@@ dez , a state con@@ gres@@ sman for Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to &apos;s party , the PR@@ I .
Partic@@ ularly in terms of security and the economy economy economy , we &apos;re hoping for an interesting and true change which our our our country so badly needs .
After an un@@ broken 81 years in power the PR@@ I was a ou@@ sted in by Vic@@ ente Fox .
Con@@ gres@@ sman Ol@@ ver@@ a ad@@ mits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los P@@ inos , there is much expec@@ tation within the party about En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to .
And he re@@ jects the opposition &apos;s character@@ isation of the new president as lacking substance .
He &apos;s a very straight@@ forward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
He &apos;s an excellent stat@@ es@@ man and , above all , he &apos;s someone who knows how to listen .
But on the other side of the state , , , that is not the impression many people have of their former govern@@ or .
In Ne@@ zah@@ u@@ alco@@ y@@ ot@@ l , also known as Ci@@ u@@ dad Ne@@ za , the contrast with the co@@ b@@ b@@ led streets of Valle del Bra@@ vo couldn &apos;t be shar@@ per .
Tu@@ cked away under motorway fl@@ y@@ over@@ s , it is in many ways a sub@@ ur@@ b of Mexico City itself .
And the problems in the municipality are also g@@ rit@@ ty and and and and urban .
Ear@@ lier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds , and violence against women is particularly acute .
On a patch of wa@@ st@@ eland by a vast land@@ fill site , the bodies of doz@@ ens of mur@@ dered women have been dump@@ ed over the past two years alone .
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to was govern@@ or , a rate much higher than than than than in the not@@ ori@@ ously violent city of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z - a place syn@@ onymous with the murder of innocent women .
Mr P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to &apos;s critics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of fem@@ ici@@ de while he was in office .
At worst , they acc@@ use his administration of turning blind eye .
In a concrete home typical of the run@@ down neighbourhood , Ir@@ inea Bu@@ en@@ dia stru@@ gg@@ les to fight back the te@@ ars as she shows me photos of her late late daughter , Mari@@ ana L@@ una .
According to the official version of events , Mari@@ ana committed suici@@ de in 2010 .
However her family believes she was mur@@ dered by her partner .
&quot; When I arrived at her house it it seemed her body had been wash@@ ed , &quot; S@@ enor@@ a Bu@@ en@@ dia rec@@ alls .
There were signs she &apos;d been be@@ aten , and rig@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in .
her mother re@@ counts the story , a picture of in Mari@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word Justice
However , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
The state authorities have treated me like I &apos;m an old go@@ ssi@@ p , a troub@@ le@@ -@@ maker , a wh@@ iner .
What they want is that one accepts they say and sh@@ uts up .
&quot; But that can &apos;t be right when there were so many irregularities and om@@ is@@ sions , &quot; she says .
As President P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to receives the s@@ ash on , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
T@@ ens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over over over over the past six years and and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
&quot; I hope he &apos;s the same of president as he was a govern@@ or , &quot; says PR@@ I Con@@ gres@@ sman Ol@@ ver@@ a in Valle del Bra@@ vo .
That , however , is exactly what victims &apos; in Ci@@ u@@ dad Ne@@ za most fear .
Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing didn &apos;t compla@@ in about mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , prosec@@ ut@@ ors cont@@ end
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors try to counter Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing &apos;s claims of abuse in con@@ fin@@ ement
The hearing focuses on Mann@@ ing &apos;s time in the military bri@@ g at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Vir@@ g@@ inia
Def@@ ense wants dis@@ missed on grounds that Mann@@ ing &apos;s con@@ fin@@ ement was harsh
The Army private is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classified
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors tried to establish Friday Friday Friday that Army private Bra@@ d@@ ley Mann@@ ing -- charged in the largest le@@ ak of of of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to compla@@ in about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment he &apos;s alleg@@ ing he suffered in is military cu@@ sto@@ dy .
While cross@@ -@@ examining Mann@@ ing at a pre@@ -@@ trial hearing at F@@ t . Me@@ ade , Mar@@ y@@ land , prosec@@ utor Maj@@ . Ash@@ den F@@ ein asser@@ ted that records of weekly visits Mann@@ ing had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Vir@@ g@@ inia , show no complaints about his treatment .
The cross@@ -@@ examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion have Mann@@ ing &apos;s case dis@@ missed on grounds that his con@@ fin@@ ement has been harsh the and has amoun@@ ted to enough punishment -- came a day after Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied that he had considered suici@@ de while in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
The Army intelligence analy@@ st , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of ste@@ aling thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
The material was then published online by Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
Wiki@@ Le@@ aks has never confirmed that Mann@@ ing was the source of its information .
In Friday &apos;s hearing , F@@ ein reviewed with Mann@@ ing the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Mann@@ ing during his detention at Qu@@ an@@ tico &apos;s bri@@ g , where I he was held under a hei@@ gh@@ tened con@@ fin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
Offic@@ ers would ask a Mann@@ ing questions and write down his responses .
When F@@ ein asked about the forms Friday , Mann@@ ing acknowledged that he rated treatment treatment treatment treatment by his gu@@ ards as &quot; excellent &quot; and treatment by the facility overall as &quot; very professional . &quot;
The forms show complaints of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , even though the officers asked Mann@@ ing directly about his treatment , F@@ ein con@@ ten@@ ded .
Mann@@ ing responded that he would verb@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn &apos;t record the .
&quot; They would write down &apos; no issues &apos; ( after discussing the concerns ) , and it didn &apos;t necessarily mean I didn &apos;t bring something up , &quot; Mann@@ ing said .
The judge , Army Col@@ . Den@@ ise L@@ ind , also asked Mann@@ ing why he didn &apos;t compla@@ in about his his his his treatment during and a January 2011 meeting that with a board examining the suici@@ dal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
Mann@@ ing rep@@ lied that his intention during that meeting was to get his &quot; prevention of injury &quot; status down@@ gra@@ ded .
The military they put him on this restrictive restrictive status -- a step suici@@ de watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
&quot; I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my view@@ point , &quot; Mann@@ ing said .
Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Ku@@ wait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the bri@@ g at Marine Base Qu@@ an@@ tico in Vir@@ g@@ inia in July 2010 .
He said he contem@@ pl@@ ated suici@@ de in Ku@@ wait and once passed out there due to the heat .
He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dist@@ res@@ sing .
&quot; My world just shr@@ ink to Camp Ara@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that c@@ age , &quot; Mann@@ ing said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that c@@ age .
Once at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Mann@@ ing said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
Mann@@ ing said he was allowed only a mat@@ t@@ ress , blan@@ ket , fli@@ p@@ -@@ flo@@ ps , some clothes and his gl@@ asses .
He said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
Mann@@ ing said he always sle@@ pt with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
If gu@@ ards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
Mann@@ ing &apos;s lawyer filed a formal objec@@ tion to Mann@@ ing &apos;s treatment in January 2011 .
Mann@@ ing was moved to the military prison at Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , K@@ ans@@ as , in April 2011 .
Also Friday , the judge Mann@@ ing about an alleg@@ ation that he made in Thursday &apos;s testim@@ ony -- that after being forced to sleep n@@ aked one night in his Qu@@ an@@ tico cell , he was forced to stand n@@ aked in front of gu@@ ards and other in@@ m@@ ates during a morning head count .
Mann@@ ing had t@@ esti@@ fied that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blan@@ ket during the head count .
Under ques@@ tioning from the judge Friday , Mann@@ ing said he in@@ ferred from his guard &apos;s order that he should drop a blan@@ ket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied Thursday that he was forced to sleep n@@ aked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn &apos;t a danger to himself .
Mann@@ ing said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ ist@@ band of his under@@ wear or his fli@@ p@@ -@@ flo@@ ps to hur@@ t himself but ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t done so .
That night , Mann@@ ing t@@ esti@@ fied , his under@@ wear , fli@@ p@@ -@@ flo@@ ps and gl@@ asses were removed from his of cell .
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences con@@ fin@@ ement into account of and sharp@@ ly reduce his sentence should he be convic@@ ted at his cour@@ t@@ -@@ mar@@ tial , which is expected to begin early next year .
The defense has said it plans to have Mann@@ ing ple@@ ad guilty to less@@ er off@@ enses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
The hearing hearing hearing hearing is scheduled to resu@@ me this weekend , with prosec@@ ut@@ ors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warran@@ ted .
The Pent@@ ag@@ on has maintained that Mann@@ ing was held in accordance with rules governing all maxim@@ um@@ -@@ cu@@ sto@@ dy de@@ tain@@ ees at Qu@@ an@@ tico .
Coun@@ ts against Mann@@ ing include ai@@ ding the enemy , w@@ ron@@ g@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , trans@@ mitting national defense information and the@@ ft of public property or records .
If he &apos;s convic@@ ted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
My Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American identity crisis
He says many were forced leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mex@@ ic@@ ans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mex@@ ic@@ ans of hard times , he says
Nav@@ arre@@ tte says Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans are caught caught caught caught between two two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the conc@@ ourse and arrived at the immigration processing processing processing processing area when I I got st@@ um@@ ped . . .
Sign@@ s pointed the way two lines : one for &quot; Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ os &quot; ( &quot; Mex@@ ic@@ ans &quot; ) , another for &quot; Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os &quot; ( &quot; Fore@@ igners . &quot; )
I stood there for a few seconds , un@@ sure of where to go .
Gro@@ wing up in Central California , I had been called a &quot; Mex@@ ican &quot; my entire life .
It &apos;s ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends in New York describe themselves as &quot; Italian . &quot;
, I settled on &quot; Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American . &quot;
But , this was Mexico .
And , in the hom@@ eland of my grand@@ father , there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or hy@@ ph@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak , good enough to handle either end end end end of an interview interview interview in in in in language .
But I don don don &apos;t have the voc@@ abul@@ ary of a native , on and I can &apos;t sha@@ ke my American acc@@ ent .
So I took my U.S. passport and got in in in the line for Ex@@ tran@@ jer@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when Mex@@ ican pre@@ sident@@ -@@ elect En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
On the agenda , as usual , when the the the the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to was also e@@ ager to talk about the growth of the Mex@@ ican economy , which is one reason that Mex@@ ic@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the States .
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Uni@@ on@@ -@@ style trading blo@@ c in North America .
And P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to vo@@ wed to continue Mexico &apos;s war against the drug car@@ tels , even though he offered no specific@@ s .
For Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with with with with hard feelings .
Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States inv@@ aded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of ri@@ f@@ le .
But for Mex@@ ic@@ ans , who think in terms centuries , not minutes , the remin@@ ders are everywhere .
So the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mex@@ ican press , and among the eli@@ tes -- complaints about how the Americans are en@@ cro@@ aching upon their neighb@@ or &apos;s sovereignty .
And the children of Monte@@ zu@@ ma go the war@@ path .
And , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the than 35 million Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans living in the United States .
You want to talk about hard feelings ?
There is plenty .
Mexico has winners lo@@ sers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn &apos;t .
The only reason you have so many people of Mex@@ ican anc@@ est@@ ry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Pho@@ enix , Den@@ ver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grand@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
And more often than not , that person person fit a a a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor , etc .
We &apos;re their off@@ spring and we &apos;re lo@@ yal to them .
Not Mexico .
And even though we may now be living the American Dre@@ am , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it &apos;s the American Dre@@ am we &apos;re living of , and not the the the Mex@@ ican one .
Our identity might sometimes be fu@@ zz@@ y , but our loy@@ alty is clear
It &apos;s to the United States .
Besides , we &apos;re aware that many of the elite Mex@@ ic@@ ans in the ruling class don &apos;t like us .
The feeling feeling feeling feeling is mutual .
They see us as a remin@@ der of a humili@@ ating defeat and and and and look down on us in@@ fer@@ ior stock that isn sufficiently Mex@@ ican .
Our Spanish never be good enough , our ties to of Mexico never strong strong strong strong enough .
Our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
If our families ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t failed in Mexico , they w@@ ouldn &apos;t have left .
And we w@@ ouldn &apos;t now find ourselves tra@@ pped behind the sil@@ k cur@@ tain , living well in the United but lost sou@@ ls nonetheless .
My wife , who was born in Gu@@ adal@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States as a child , remin@@ ds me that there is fri@@ ction between Mex@@ ic@@ ans and Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans because Mex@@ ic@@ ans have a fir@@ mer gra@@ sp of they are and Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans res@@ ent that .
While she in &apos;s &apos;s a U.S. citizen , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
Meanwhile , many Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans know don &apos;t feel like they &apos;re a part part part of either .
We love listening to the Mex@@ ican band , Los T@@ ig@@ res del Nor@@ te , but also to Bru@@ ce Sp@@ ring@@ ste@@ en .
You get the best of both worlds , but you &apos;re ro@@ oted in neither .
In Mexico , we &apos;re seen as Americans .
And in the United States , we &apos;re considered Mex@@ ican .
Now , to complic@@ ate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mex@@ ican leaders and parts of the intelli@@ gent@@ sia want to re@@ connect with the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a .
They want to put Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans to work as ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft &quot; amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors &quot; for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
Y@@ e@@ ah .
That &apos;s not going to happen .
To@@ o many hard feelings .
And , income inequality and ra@@ mp@@ ant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re on your own , am@@ ig@@ os .
That &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s fair .
If at least some Mex@@ ic@@ ans aren &apos;t yet ready to and for@@ give the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how family members were treated much recently than that .
H@@ mm@@ m .
Maybe we &apos;re more &quot; Mex@@ ican &quot; than I thought .
Old batt@@ les , new Middle East
The ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Ara@@ bs and Jews in the Middle East ? ? ?
Another round bloo@@ d@@ shed suggests that any such such hope is v@@ ain .
Am@@ id the fu@@ tile arguments over who started it , sco@@ res of buildings have been been been been reduced to rub@@ ble ; more than 140 Palestinians , , , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missi@@ les from Gaza have land@@ ed near Tel Avi@@ v , Israel &apos;s metro@@ polis , and the hol@@ y city of Jerusalem .
But though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stu@@ ck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing for .
The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and are caught up in the regional tur@@ mo@@ il .
Maybe this will make their struggle bloo@@ di@@ er than before .
However there are reasons for thinking it could just break le@@ th@@ al stal@@ em@@ ate .
A war that is neither lost or won
At first sight , optim@@ ism looks very hard to justify now .
Even if the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire agreed on November 21st holds , this week &apos;s fighting has the ha@@ w@@ ks on both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the Islam@@ ist movement that has ruled Gaza since , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ bing .
Despite killing some of its leaders and bot@@ tling up Gaza &apos;s 1.@@ 7@@ m people in one of of the most w@@ ret@@ ched and crow@@ ded cor@@ ners of the planet , Israel has failed to to to destroy Hamas .
Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter ri@@ vals in Fat@@ ah , the more moderate Palestinian fac@@ tion .
Moreover , Hamas &apos;s leaders may well conclude that time is on their side .
Islam@@ ists across the Arab world have gained cl@@ out , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
, a res@@ urgent regional power that was once Israel &apos;s closest Muslim ally , , , , has taken up Hamas &apos;s cause ; so has Q@@ atar , one of the rich@@ est and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
Jubil@@ ant Hamas people say an Islam@@ ist c@@ res@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the H@@ iz@@ bul@@ lah part@@ y@@ -@@ cum@@ -@@ mili@@ tia holds s@@ way , Syria , where reb@@ els of an increasingly Islam@@ ist b@@ ent may t@@ opp@@ le B@@ ash@@ ar Assad , and on down through Jordan where Hamas &apos;s allies are men@@ ac@@ ing the king .
Above all , on Israel &apos;s southern flan@@ k , rise of the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood under President Mu@@ ham@@ mad Mor@@ si in Egypt is , by far the most popul@@ ous and pi@@ vot@@ al of Arab countries , has changed the region &apos;s balance .
Ho@@ sn@@ i M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak the secular des@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
By contrast , the Bro@@ ther@@ hood is a cou@@ sin of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and and America .
Meanwhile , Israel &apos;s hard@@ lin@@ ers will draw the the the opposite conclusions .
In military terms that , Hamas has been put back in its box .
Israel &apos;s Ir@@ on D@@ ome anti@@ -@@ missi@@ le system has proved its worth and many of Hamas &apos;s missi@@ les have been destroyed .
Israelis will sleep more sound@@ ly - for a a a a while .
In diplomatic terms , America is as ste@@ ad@@ fast as ever ; many many European countries also bl@@ amed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
Above all , Israel has prosp@@ ered , especially under Bin@@ y@@ amin Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u , prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
Although ro@@ ckets from have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of suici@@ de@@ -@@ bom@@ bers , thanks in part to the barrier that bit@@ es into the West Bank , the main ch@@ unk of a w@@ ou@@ ld@@ -@@ be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illeg@@ ality in international law .
Mr Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u , whose Li@@ ku@@ d party has mer@@ ged with an even more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish lot under A@@ vig@@ dor Lie@@ ber@@ man in the run@@ -@@ up to an election on January 2@@ 2nd , is sitting pretty .
Why co@@ ddle those twi@@ sty Palestinians by by by by giving them a state of their own ?
If they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire ro@@ ckets just as their comp@@ atri@@ ots have done in Gaza ? ? ?
Bet@@ ter to keep them behind that wall and s@@ mit@@ e them if they raise their heads .
Maybe the hard@@ lin@@ ers will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calcul@@ ations .
Even if the Islam@@ ists taking power in Egypt Egypt Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel &apos;s defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
Starting a war with the local super@@ power will hardly help the new Arab governments m@@ end their economies .
That the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire au@@ g@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something
Israelis too should look to the longer term .
With the the the the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depri@@ ving Palestinians of their right to sel@@ f@@ -@@ determination is creating a powder ke@@ g that is bound one day to explo@@ de in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus explo@@ ded Tel Avi@@ v this week .
Re@@ pression is already under@@ mining democracy in in in in the Jewish state state , demo@@ graphy exacerb@@ ates this as the Arab population s@@ well@@ s .
B@@ loo@@ dy missions against against Gaza every few years to kno@@ ck back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
Both sides need pro@@ d@@ ding by out@@ si@@ ders
The answer remains the one tru@@ mp@@ eted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with c@@ eding territory for security .
The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire will give a little more le@@ verage to out@@ si@@ ders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about st@@ opping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Q@@ atar , is placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based it on the 1967 boundaries with land sw@@ aps and a shared Jerusalem .
Arab out@@ si@@ ders should also press as Hamas and Fat@@ ah to come together .
That would do more to create a Palestinian state and than the im@@ min@@ ent bid for virtual stat@@ eh@@ ood at the UN .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
During his first term , he neglec@@ ted to present his own plan for peace .
Back in the White House , he is looking just as reluc@@ tant to be drawn in .
This is wo@@ efully short@@ -@@ si@@ ghted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
That means a peace settlement between Israel and Palestinians .
C@@ ig@@ are@@ tte plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
Smoking war@@ nings and dise@@ ased body parts emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned on d@@ ull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia &apos;s wor@@ ld@@ -@@ first laws on cigare@@ tte and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand logos and colours with generic dra@@ b olive green cover@@ ings , gru@@ es@@ ome pictures of dise@@ ased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and bab@@ ies made ill by their parents &apos; smoking .
Apart from the varying health war@@ nings and images the only difference between the p@@ acks , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small font .
It is the world &apos;s most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
Australia Australia &apos;s federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stri@@ pping the hab@@ it of gl@@ am@@ our .
It It It is rel@@ ying on studies showing showing showing showing that if people have not started smoking by 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
&quot; Even from a very early age you can see kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their br@@ anding , &quot; said the federal health minister , T@@ anya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , c@@ iting studies studies studies studies that showed , for example , children linking a cro@@ wn in a logo with the idea of being a pr@@ inc@@ ess .
While Australia has one of the world &apos;s lowest smoking rates the changes will little impact on multination@@ als &apos; profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
The tobacco industry lob@@ bi@@ ed hard against the laws .
Tob@@ acco firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigare@@ ttes .
&quot; There will be serious un@@ intended consequences from the legislation , &quot; said Scott Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re of British American Tob@@ acco Australia .
Co@@ unter@@ fei@@ ters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets Australia .
O@@ thers say the laws have boo@@ sted their business .
Sand@@ ra H@@ a of Z@@ ico Import P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand cigare@@ tte cases , si@@ lic@@ on covers to m@@ ask the un@@ pal@@ at@@ able packages , had shot up from almost nothing two months since British American Tob@@ acco , Britain &apos;s Imperial Tob@@ acco , Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris and Japan Tob@@ acco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia &apos;s high court .

This is good business for us . .
The potential hit@@ ch , experts say , , , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targe@@ ting .
After a series of Australian laws bann@@ ing TV advertising and sports spon@@ sor@@ ship and requiring most s@@ ellers to hide cigare@@ ttes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and but cannot restrict overseas sites .
&quot; If you are a tobacco mark@@ eter and you &apos;ve only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the comp@@ elling place for you to be in , &quot; said B@@ eck@@ y Fre@@ em@@ an , a public health resear@@ cher at Sydney University .
Fre@@ em@@ an noted an increase in &quot; average Jo@@ e &quot; reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube , Twitter and Facebook .
We have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really lo@@ ves Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o cigare@@ ttes and they &apos;ve gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American Tob@@ acco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Hon@@ dur@@ as and the Domin@@ ican Republic challenge the new rules - the countries are claim@@ ing at the Trade Organisation that trade is being un@@ fairly restricted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
A WTO ruling is likely in mid@@ -@@ 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said the government held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging packaging .
Canada was the first country to make phot@@ ograph war@@ nings mandatory in 2001 .
They now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
Tou@@ gher laws are being being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
Many smo@@ kers in Australia remain de@@ fi@@ ant .
The pictures don &apos;t affect me . .
I just ignore them .
&quot; You just gra@@ b a smoke and put it away , &quot; said Vic@@ tor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a phot@@ ograph of a mouth tum@@ our .
Hon@@ est@@ ly , there &apos;s only one reason I &apos;d stop , and that &apos;s my little girl .
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the tob@@ ac@@ con@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uniform packaging made it harder st@@ ack his shel@@ ves
&quot; It used to take me an hour to un@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , &quot; Y@@ u said .
&quot; The government should have just banned them altogether and then we &apos;d go OK , fine , we &apos;re done , we &apos;ll shut up shop , &quot; he said , thro@@ wing his hands up in the air .
In a Con@@ st@@ antly P@@ lug@@ ge@@ d@@ -@@ In World , It It It &apos;s Not All Bad to Be Bo@@ red
I spent five un@@ expected hours in of an airport this Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bo@@ re@@ dom .
I won &apos;t lie to you
Hal@@ f a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty te@@ di@@ ous , even with the di@@ stra@@ c@@ tions of books , magazines and i@@ Ph@@ ones ( not to mention d@@ ut@@ y@@ -@@ free shopping ) . .
But increasingly , some academ@@ ics and child development experts are coming out in praise of bo@@ re@@ dom .
It &apos;s all right for us - and our children - to be bo@@ red on occasion , they say
It forces the brain to go on interesting tan@@ g@@ ents , perhaps fo@@ stering creativity .
And because most of us are almost consistently p@@ lug@@ ged into one screen screen screen or another these days , we don &apos;t experience the benefits of bo@@ re@@ dom .
should we emb@@ race bo@@ re@@ dom ?
Yes .
And no .
But I &apos;ll get back to that .
First of all , like many people , I assumed bo@@ re@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the adv@@ ent of more more leisure time .
Not , says Peter T@@ oo@@ h@@ ey , a professor of Greek and and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ g@@ ary in Canada and the author of &quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom : A Li@@ vely History &quot; ( Y@@ ale University Press , 2011 ) .
Bo@@ re@@ dom actually has a very long history , &quot; he said .
There &apos;s Latin gra@@ ff@@ iti about bo@@ re@@ dom on the walls of P@@ omp@@ ei@@ i dating from the first century .
Then there &apos;s question of how we define bo@@ re@@ dom .
The trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different , said John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , an associ@@ ate professor of psych@@ ology at York University in On@@ t@@ ario , Canada .
After looking over the research literature and and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his defined bo@@ re@@ dom as an experience of &quot; wanting to , but being unable to engage in satis@@ fying activity . &quot;
What separ@@ ates bo@@ re@@ dom from ap@@ ath@@ y , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
With ap@@ ath@@ y , he said , there is no urge to do something .
The experience of bo@@ re@@ dom , he said , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ ruption of the attention process , associated with with with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . &quot;
Bo@@ re@@ dom can sound an aw@@ ful lot like de@@ pression .
But Professor E@@ ast@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bo@@ red tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are de@@ pressed see the problem as themselves .
Sometimes think we &apos;re bo@@ red when just have difficulty concent@@ rating .
In their study , &quot; The Un@@ engaged M@@ ind : Defin@@ ing Bo@@ re@@ dom in Terms of At@@ tention , &quot; which appeared in the journ@@ al Per@@ spec@@ tives on Psych@@ ological Science in September , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine on article .
Some groups heard a loud and un@@ related television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely notic@@ eable , while the third group didn &apos;t hear the sound@@ track at all .
The ones who heard the low@@ -@@ level TV reported more bo@@ re@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concent@@ rating but were not sure why , and attri@@ buted that difficulty to bo@@ re@@ dom .
When you &apos;re trying to focus on a difficult or eng@@ aging task , dis@@ ruption of attention can lead to bo@@ re@@ dom , said Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , an associ@@ ate professor professor of neuro@@ science at the the University of Gu@@ el@@ ph On@@ t@@ ario and one of the authors of the study .
On the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something d@@ ull , &quot; such as looking for bad wid@@ gets a factory line line line line , di@@ stra@@ c@@ ting music can help you not be bo@@ red . &quot;
In fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ ir@@ ming and do@@ od@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bo@@ re@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physi@@ cally al@@ ert .
&quot; Research shows that kids who are I allowed to fi@@ d@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to to to to sit still , &quot; Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
We all experience bo@@ re@@ dom at some - my flight delay , a d@@ ron@@ ing speaker , a particularly te@@ di@@ ous movie .
But some individuals are more likely to be bo@@ red than others .
To help measure this , researchers developed a &quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom P@@ ron@@ eness Sc@@ ale &quot; in the 1980s .
The scale includes questions like , &quot; Many things I have to do are repe@@ ti@@ tive and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous , &quot; and &quot; I have so many interests , I don &apos;t have time to everything . &quot;
Using such sc@@ ales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bo@@ red more often than girls , said Stephen Vo@@ dan@@ ovi@@ ch , a professor of psych@@ ology at the University of West Florida , when it comes need@@ ing more , and a variety of , external stim@@ ulation .
But in general , te@@ en@@ agers are a pretty j@@ aded lot .
In 1991 , Re@@ ed Lar@@ son , a professor of human and community development at the University of Il@@ lin@@ ois , conducted an experiment in which he cont@@ acted almost 400 te@@ en@@ agers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ eper .
He found that 32 percent of ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents said they were bo@@ red in school and doing home@@ work , while 23 percent said they were bo@@ red when they weren &apos;t in school .
On the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bo@@ red .
Professor Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bo@@ re@@ dom percent@@ ages now , 21 years later , would and be higher or lower .
But he said he did know that &quot; ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence is a peak period for bo@@ re@@ dom , &quot; largely because children and te@@ en@@ agers are given a lot of control over what what they want to do .
So back to my original question : Is bo@@ re@@ dom good for you ?
Sometimes no , because because because because in its extreme can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gam@@ ble or indul@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
On the other hand , many philosoph@@ ers and writers discuss connection between bo@@ re@@ dom and creativity , said Professor Vo@@ dan@@ ovi@@ ch , who has been studying the issue that for more than two decades . we
&quot; Bo@@ re@@ dom is the brain &apos;s way to tell you you should be doing something else , &quot; said G@@ ary Mar@@ cus , a professor of psych@@ ology at N@@ .@@ Y@@ .@@ U .
But the brain doesn &apos;t always know the appropriate thing to do
If you &apos;re bo@@ red and use that energy to play guitar and co@@ ok , it will make you happy .
But if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
So if your child is bo@@ red and you give him an i@@ Pad , he may not be bo@@ red anymore , but he has@@ n &apos;t learned how to enter@@ tain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
And &quot; that sel@@ f@@ -@@ regulation transfers transfers from one situation to other , &quot; he said .
Your k@@ id doesn &apos;t just learn to enter@@ tain himself , but gets more sel@@ f@@ -@@ control in other areas .
I don &apos;t think we really want to celebrate bo@@ re@@ dom .
Nor should we be too critical of it .
Rather , our goal should be to feel feel comfortable away from the constant ch@@ at@@ ter of activity and technology . is
Professor E@@ ast@@ wood agreed
&quot; We it frame it as we need to be bo@@ red more , but bo@@ re@@ dom is an ag@@ on@@ izing , rest@@ less desire to be connected with something meaningful , &quot; he said .
What people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ plug and enjoy down time .
&quot; In an environment where we are constantly over@@ stimul@@ ated , &quot; this he said , &quot; it &apos;s hard to find ways to engage when the noise sh@@ uts down . &quot;
In Col@@ or@@ ado , No Play@@ book for New to Mari@@ ju@@ ana Law
Anth@@ ony O@@ ro@@ z@@ co , 19 , a community college student and so@@ ccer player in sou@@ the@@ astern Col@@ or@@ ado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nu@@ g@@ gets mari@@ ju@@ ana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said that one day in September he and and a few friends were driving in Lam@@ ar , on the pla@@ ins near the K@@ ans@@ as border , when they were pul@@ led over .
After the police officer found mari@@ ju@@ ana in the car Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co was issued a sum@@ mon@@ s for possession and drug par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia - pet@@ ty off@@ enses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
&quot; We get treated like criminals , &quot; Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said .
But is he he he he one ?
In the uncertain weeks after Col@@ or@@ ado &apos;s vote to leg@@ alize small of mari@@ ju@@ ana for recreational use , the the answer in of minor drug cases depends less on the than on location .
H@@ und@@ reds of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ or mari@@ ju@@ ana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small@@ -@@ scale possession that will be legally sanc@@ tioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
But prosec@@ ut@@ ors in more conservative prec@@ inc@@ ts in Col@@ or@@ ado have vo@@ wed to press ahead with existing mari@@ ju@@ ana cases and are still c@@ iting possession .
At the same time , several towns from the Den@@ ver sub@@ ur@@ bs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , stat@@ e@@ -@@ licensed retail mari@@ ju@@ ana shops from opening in their communities .
&quot; This is evol@@ ving so quickly that I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen next , &quot; said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in A@@ ur@@ ora , just east of Den@@ ver .
Regul@@ ators in Washington State are also scrat@@ ching their heads .
And And And And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec@@ . 1 , 2013 .
They say that Col@@ or@@ ado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regulating mari@@ ju@@ ana , first for medical use and now recre@@ ation@@ ally .
&quot; Col@@ or@@ ado has a more regulated market , so they they they will be a good guide , &quot; said Bri@@ an E. Smith , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Control Board .
But no place system , Mr. Smith conc@@ eded , do more than suggest what might might might might work .
&quot; There &apos;s no precedent for us to follow , &quot; he said .
Washington &apos;s law , called I@@ -@@ 50@@ 2 , takes takes effect on Dec@@ . 6 , which also leaves a year of lim@@ bo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized possession will .
And there are thor@@ ny questions that must be resolved during that , like how to balance the state &apos;s mandate of &quot; adequate access &quot; to mari@@ ju@@ ana with its prohi@@ bitions on c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child center .
&quot; No@@ where will it be more difficult to site site site site a licensed c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle metro@@ politan area , &quot; said Ben Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Center for Legal Cann@@ ab@@ is , a recently formed research group .
On Nov@@ . 21 , Chief O@@ ates in A@@ ur@@ ora sent his officers an e@@ -@@ mail announ@@ cing that the city att@@ or@@ ney would would would would no longer prosec@@ uting small mari@@ ju@@ ana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop stop stop charging people for those crimes &quot; effective immediately . &quot;
Chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical mari@@ ju@@ ana gro@@ wers , and that they would still pursue drug traffi@@ ckers and dealers .
In northern Col@@ or@@ ado &apos;s W@@ eld County , district att@@ or@@ ney , K@@ en Bu@@ ck , represents a stricter view
After the vote , he said his office with would continue pursuing mari@@ ju@@ ana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
Right now , 1@@ 19 people face charges of poss@@ essing two oun@@ ces or less of mari@@ ju@@ ana , though many facing other charges .
&quot; Our office has an obligation to prosec@@ ute off@@ enses that were crimes at the time they occurred , Mr. Bu@@ ck said in a statement .
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mes@@ a County , where voters rejected the mari@@ ju@@ ana initiative .
The police in Grand Jun@@ ction , the coun@@ ty &apos;s largest city , are no longer c@@ iting adults for possession of small amounts .
The coun@@ ty &apos;s district att@@ or@@ ney , Pe@@ te Hau@@ tz@@ inger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dis@@ miss all of the pending possession cases .
&quot; I do not think I &apos;m wa@@ sting my time continuing to enforce the law it changes , &quot; he said .
Although 55 percent of Col@@ or@@ ado voters supported the measure , bringing recreational mari@@ ju@@ ana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to simple .
And the contradic@@ tory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambi@@ val@@ ence among local officials about the state &apos;s big green experiment .
&quot; It &apos;s a cultural barrier &quot; with district att@@ or@@ neys , said S@@ ean Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , a Den@@ ver lawyer who represents mari@@ ju@@ ana def@@ end@@ ants and is a local spo@@ kes@@ man for the the the the National Organization for Reform of Mari@@ ju@@ ana La@@ ws .
&quot; They spent so of their lives prosec@@ uting people that they still still still don &apos;t really accept that this is legal , &quot; he said .
As the first states to treat small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana like alcohol , Col@@ or@@ ado and Washington are po@@ ised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ alization .
As advocates state officials plan for a new fron@@ tier of leg@@ alized sales , they are also anxi@@ ously awaiting direction from the federal , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of mari@@ ju@@ ana as federal crimes .
Ad@@ voc@@ ates for leg@@ alized mari@@ ju@@ ana are hoping the Department yiel@@ ds .
Despite some high@@ -@@ profile arre@@ sts of medical mari@@ ju@@ ana patients and s@@ ellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical mari@@ ju@@ ana businesses to operate in in in Col@@ or@@ ado , Washington and 16 other states states states states .
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to sei@@ ze a small bag of drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the stat@@ e@@ -@@ regulated recreational mari@@ ju@@ ana allowed under the new laws , said K@@ ev@@ in A. Sa@@ bet , , a former drug policy adv@@ iser in the Obama administration .
Several cities in Col@@ or@@ ado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
Even before Elec@@ tion Day , some local governments approved mor@@ atori@@ ums on any new mari@@ ju@@ ana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
Last week , the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six@@ -@@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
We We We don &apos;t want to be put in a position where we license som@@ ebody and then have a big federal , &quot; said Bo@@ b Nichol@@ son , a City Council member .
Our community voted against this amendment .
We We We &apos;re looking at what the community voted for ver@@ sus what the state voted for .
There &apos;s an aw@@ ful lot of questions .
Pet@@ ron@@ ella W@@ y@@ att : I was bul@@ lied out of Oxford for being a T@@ ory
It is not just today &apos;s university students who are attacked for their views
I can &apos;t remember a time when I didn &apos;t dream winning a place at at Oxford .
Both my father and my el@@ der brother had been at what I imag@@ ined was the world &apos;s greatest seat of learning , a modern@@ -@@ day win@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ lus@@ hed Greek sym@@ posi@@ um encouraging the dual pillars of civili@@ sation , free thinking and tolerance .
Yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ c@@ ester College in the late Ei@@ gh@@ ties to read history , I &apos;d packed my bags , pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ating the first scandal of my life .
My father broke down and cri@@ ed .
Fri@@ ends were ba@@ ff@@ led .
The E@@ ven@@ ing Standard di@@ ary claimed I &apos;d qu@@ it because I objec@@ ted to fellow under@@ gradu@@ ates having sex in the room next to mine .
The writer A N Wil@@ son announced wag@@ g@@ ish@@ ly that &apos;d depar@@ ted because I was forced to out of chi@@ pped mu@@ gs .
The truth was less dro@@ ll .
I be ran away .
Yes , ran , because I had been subject systematic bul@@ lying and intim@@ id@@ ation .
Not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was persec@@ uted for one reason only , and in this cra@@ dle of supposed en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment it was both big@@ oted and bar@@ b@@ ari@@ c : my father , the late Woo@@ d@@ row W@@ y@@ att , was a high@@ -@@ profile adv@@ iser to Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher and I was a Con@@ servative suppor@@ ter .
Why bring this up now , you you you might ask .
Well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of Ri@@ ght@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ centre students are suffering a similar persecution .
Such is the institution@@ alised and increasing hat@@ red of T@@ ory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equ@@ al@@ -@@ rights protection as ga@@ ys , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
Con@@ servative members of Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i College &apos;s junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim I they are &quot; often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel un@@ welcome &quot; because of political views .
They want to create a post on the college &apos;s equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be ai@@ red freely .
Their situation wasn &apos;t helped by a recent BBC Two documentary , W@@ onder@@ land : Young , B@@ right and on the Right , about student politics , which portra@@ yed T@@ ories as od@@ d@@ balls and neo@@ -@@ Naz@@ is .
It featured gradu@@ ate Jo@@ e Coo@@ ke , former president of the Oxford University Con@@ servative Association ( O@@ UC@@ A ) , travelling in a Roll@@ s@@ -@@ Ro@@ y@@ ce , sporting a silver and sil@@ ver@@ -@@ t@@ opp@@ ed cane .
At other universities , Con@@ servative students say say say say they are being treated as &quot; scap@@ ego@@ ats &quot; for the introduction of higher tu@@ ition fees . &quot;
Lu@@ ke Black , 20 , vic@@ e@@ -@@ president of Not@@ t@@ ingham University Con@@ servative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there there there there a growing L@@ ef@@ t@@ -@@ wing bi@@ as at universities .
assume we are like the Bul@@ ling@@ don Club without meeting us . &quot;
Sam@@ uel Rober@@ ts , , a history student at Cor@@ p@@ us Christ@@ i , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is &quot; un@@ comfortable , &quot; while Steph@@ an@@ ie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ UC@@ A , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Right of centre .
&quot; This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , &quot; she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 I , a cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ingly sh@@ y 18@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old .
H@@ at@@ red of the Con@@ servative Party was at its most f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le .
The year before , university had voted to refuse Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher - a former student - an hon@@ or@@ ary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
The atmosphere would have made a St@@ al@@ in@@ ist sh@@ u@@ d@@ der with ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion .
During the first few days of fresh@@ ers &quot; week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , , , , I had a taste of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only con@@ ni@@ ved in the ta@@ unting of of of T@@ ory under@@ gradu@@ ates but took part with reli@@ sh .
The politics the min@@ ers &quot; strike , priv@@ atisation and the government &apos;s opposition to sanctions against apar@@ thei@@ d South Africa were brought into the wood@@ -@@ pan@@ elled rooms of the tut@@ orial .
My first one and involved transl@@ ating 18@@ th@@ -@@ century French texts into English , and I was un@@ prepared for what followed .
&quot; Mis@@ s W@@ y@@ att , &quot; said a the don Harry Pit@@ t ( now dec@@ e@@ ased ) , &quot; please translate the first paragraph . &quot;
st@@ umb@@ led over it .
small man with a face like ca@@ ke bat@@ ter , Pit@@ t was big on bile .
&quot; Do Th@@ at@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stup@@ id ? &quot; he demanded .
The other under@@ gradu@@ ates gi@@ gg@@ led .
T@@ ears pri@@ cked the back of my eyes .
&quot; suggest you take some basic French lessons your spare time - that is , if you &apos;re not too busy soci@@ alising , &quot; Pit@@ t s@@ nar@@ led .
I wal@@ ked back to my rooms a dis@@ con@@ sol@@ ate figure .
At dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
It was a secon@@ d@@ -@@ year English named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ UC@@ A .
&quot; I know who you are , &quot; he said kin@@ dly .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s like that .
Anyone suspec@@ ted being a T@@ ory is picked on .
It &apos;s bad enough for me , they know your father is close to Mar@@ gare@@ t Th@@ at@@ cher so it will be worse worse for you .
Most T@@ ory fresh@@ ers pre@@ tend they &apos;re Labour .
Later , at a local pu@@ b , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ simul@@ ate .
I insi@@ sted that I didn &apos;t agree with everything of Mrs Th@@ at@@ cher said .
This plo@@ y proved un@@ successful .
A first year PPE student , who , ir@@ on@@ ically , had been to E@@ ton , said : &quot; You &apos;re the daughter of a fasc@@ ist pi@@ g . &quot;
You contam@@ inated .
Other students took up the refra@@ in .
I was per@@ ver@@ ted , dirty .
&quot; How do T@@ ories have sex ? &quot; one asked .
They beat . each other , don &apos;t they ?
I felt the way homo@@ sexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Six@@ ties .
Would I ever able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
Would I be forced to meet li@@ ke@@ -@@ minded people only after dark ?
Would I have to turn to Labour and sup@@ press my natural inc@@ lin@@ ations ?
The three years before me stret@@ ched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ stra@@ c@@ ism and isolation .
The only openly T@@ ory don was Nor@@ man St@@ one , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college .
He was h@@ ated for being not only a Con@@ servative but a foreign policy adv@@ iser to Th@@ at@@ cher and one of her speech writers .
He was hardly ever there .
He lo@@ ath@@ ed the place as provin@@ cial and pet@@ ty , and for its adher@@ ence to the Mar@@ x@@ ist@@ -@@ determin@@ ist view of history .
In 1997 he took up a prof@@ ess@@ or@@ ship at at at at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; won &apos;t be happy here , &quot; he told me .
I began comm@@ uting from from from Oxford to my &quot; house in London , finding refu@@ ge with my more open@@ -@@ minded metro@@ politan friends and family .
I my father I h@@ ated Oxford and why .
He was incre@@ dul@@ ous .
During his his his his time there in the For@@ ties all political views had been accepted .
&quot; But it &apos;s the best place in the world , &quot; he said pa@@ the@@ tically .
They w@@ ouldn &apos;t do that , not among my dre@@ aming spi@@ res .
Even my Communist of friends always had im@@ pec@@ cable man@@ ners .
His r@@ he@@ um@@ y eyes began to clou@@ d .
Gi@@ ve it a chance .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s all just a te@@ ase .
It would break my heart if you left .
Ex@@ hau@@ sted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional emotional emotional was deterior@@ ating .
A A A A male friend of mine , also a T@@ ory suppor@@ ter , had succ@@ um@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ ounced his cre@@ ed .
During a tut@@ orial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seri@@ ousness , that I was an &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
In@@ war@@ dly b@@ lus@@ hing with shame , admitted to being &quot; bra@@ in@@ wash@@ ed by my parents &quot; and called them &quot; old fo@@ ols . &quot;
The resp@@ ite was short .
It was my father who dro@@ ve the nail into the coff@@ in of my Oxford career .
At the time , he wrote two colum@@ ns in the Mur@@ doch press each week .
My door was locked .
I co@@ wer@@ ed inside , after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up .
When they left , I packed a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
You may call me a s@@ ni@@ v@@ elling wi@@ mp .
But no 18@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old be subject to such intim@@ id@@ ation and vit@@ ri@@ ol in an educational institution .
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 T@@ ory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill@@ -@@ deser@@ ved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .

In the first first first first room of the exhibition open open open open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of ari@@ sto@@ cracy , from Princ@@ ess S@@ ali@@ ma@@ h A@@ ga K@@ han , Lord Snow@@ don , Princ@@ ess Mari@@ e@@ -@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al of Greece to Mar@@ gare@@ t of England .

In the &apos; 6@@ 0s and &apos; 7@@ 0s , we both lived in the Alps and were good friends .

There were twenty of us , including Sharon St@@ one and John Ken@@ ne@@ dy J@@ r .

Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal and the designer , in 2006
Many of these clients say your first Valent@@ ino is like your first love , &quot; impossible to forget forget forget . &quot;
I remember perfectly .
It was a pair of tro@@ users , a shirt , a &quot; gi@@ let &quot; wa@@ ist@@ co@@ at and jack@@ et from the of 197@@ 1@@ -@@ 1972 autum@@ n@@ -@@ winter collection .
&quot; It was a gift he gave me &quot; says Nat@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , one of the designer &apos;s m@@ uses .
&quot; I prefer him to other designers because of his femin@@ inity , his great love of women , and because he enhan@@ ces our beauty &quot; added the former Du@@ ch@@ ess Feri@@ a . .
I love the colours he uses , they really stand out and &quot; lend themselves &quot; to your face
Their propor@@ tions are perfect .
The pr@@ inc@@ ess and fashion advis@@ or Patri@@ cia della Giov@@ amp@@ a@@ ola d &apos;@@ Ar@@ en@@ berg also rem@@ embers the first time she wor@@ e Valent@@ ino .
As a te@@ en@@ ager living in Italy , I dre@@ amed of reaching the age when when when when I &apos;d &apos;d &apos;d have the chance to wear one of his evening go@@ wns ...
My time finally came in the late &apos; 9@@ 0s .
I bought my first Valent@@ ino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cou@@ sin , Prince E@@ dou@@ ard de Lig@@ ne .
It was a red dress , with a fri@@ l@@ ly sk@@ ir@@ t , dra@@ ped &quot; cor@@ sage &quot; and a stra@@ pl@@ ess nec@@ kl@@ ine .
&quot; It was a dream come true &quot; be says Princ@@ ess D &apos;@@ Ar@@ en@@ berg , the wi@@ dow of Ro@@ dri@@ go d &apos;@@ Ar@@ en@@ berg .
&quot; Valent@@ ino is in@@ different to fashion , his ob@@ session is tim@@ eless &quot; says this Italian ari@@ sto@@ cra@@ t who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
Princ@@ ess D &apos;@@ Ar@@ en@@ berg looks her cou@@ turi@@ er go@@ wns with &quot; the utmost utmost care ... because a dress not just just just a dress , it &apos;s also the many memories that go with it . &quot;
The &quot; king &quot; of fashion
&quot; grand fin@@ ale &quot; of the Som@@ er@@ set House exhibition is Mari@@ e@@ -@@ Ch@@ ant@@ al Mil@@ ler &apos;s wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995 .
It took four months &apos; work and 25 &quot; girls &quot; ( as the designer calls his se@@ am@@ stresses ) to create the pe@@ ar@@ l@@ -@@ en@@ cru@@ sted , i@@ vor@@ y@@ -@@ col@@ oured sil@@ k go@@ wn with twelve different types of l@@ ace and a train four and a half metres long . . .
According to journalist Su@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion mile@@ stone of the late 20th century , &quot; the return of high society clients . &quot;
Da@@ zz@@ led for years with the &quot; sa@@ vo@@ ir@@ -@@ ê@@ tre &quot; of the elite , Valent@@ ino is its finest exp@@ on@@ ent .
Cav@@ ali@@ ere di Gran Cro@@ ce ( I high@@ est@@ -@@ ranking distinction in Italy ) , , Cav@@ ali@@ ere del La@@ vor@@ o , Comm@@ an@@ de@@ ur de L &apos;@@ Ord@@ re des Arts et des Lett@@ res , and awarded the Legi@@ on of Hon@@ our , Gar@@ av@@ ani accum@@ ul@@ ates as many hon@@ ours as any of his , clients &apos; hus@@ bands .
&quot; I &apos;ve always been struck by his refined and calm manner , and his ne@@ at and perfect appearance &quot; &quot; acknowled@@ ges D &apos;@@ Ar@@ en@@ berg . be
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a g@@ ala dinner at the Or@@ say Museum .
He was on the table of to Coun@@ t@@ ess J@@ acqu@@ el@@ ine Ri@@ bes , a great friend of mine .
&quot; He was imm@@ ac@@ ulate , time stands still for him . &quot;
If a pr@@ inc@@ ess says that ...
The har@@ dest in the world : : the human mul@@ es of Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en
For four euros , the Indone@@ sian volcan@@ o por@@ ters risk life and and lim@@ b carrying 70 ki@@ los of sul@@ ph@@ ur along stone paths .
There are people for whom work is hell , and others who - literally - work in hell hell .
This is the case of An@@ to Wi@@ j@@ aya , one of the 400 min@@ ers who make their living taking sul@@ ph@@ ur from the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o , east of the Indone@@ sian island of Java .
To do so , he has to desc@@ end every to the bottom of the cr@@ ater , where the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ rous gas eman@@ ating from from the bo@@ wels of the earth solidi@@ fies on contact with air . . .
After breaking off large sul@@ ph@@ ur rocks , which in total can wei@@ gh up to 70 ki@@ los , he carries them in two b@@ am@@ bo@@ o bas@@ k@@ ets on his shoul@@ ders along the steep stone paths .
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcan@@ o , which rises to 2,@@ 3@@ 86 metres above sea level , but the the the the exhau@@ sted por@@ ters take over 40 minutes to get there , at sn@@ ail pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps to avoid sli@@ pping and falling over the pre@@ cip@@ ice .
They know that one sli@@ p could cost them their lives lives , as happened to a French tourist who pl@@ ung@@ ed to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en cli@@ ffs .
The Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en min@@ ers are 5 euro c@@ ents for each k@@ il@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur removed .
Once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who phot@@ ograph them like cir@@ cus mon@@ keys and then , lug@@ ging their heavy bas@@ k@@ ets , they walk three kilometres to the sc@@ ales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,@@ 8@@ 50 metres above sea level .
This is PT N@@ gri@@ mb@@ i C@@ and@@ i , a company which , since 1960 , has been explo@@ iting the volcan@@ o , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 5 euro c@@ ents ) per k@@ il@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ ur .
It then s@@ ells the sul@@ ph@@ ur for 10,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 83 c@@ ents ) to the pet@@ ro@@ chemical industry , as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is is used in the manufacture of matches , fire@@ works , cosme@@ tics , dynam@@ ite and even wh@@ it@@ ening sugar .
&quot; We generally carry 70 ki@@ los , so we get about 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 3.@@ 8 euros ) a trip &quot; explains An@@ to , who usually make three trips a day .
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhau@@ sted , but it he gets 13@@ 8@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 11.@@ 5 euros ) at the end of the day .
Although it seems a pit@@ t@@ ance for such an in@@ human effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
&quot; Min@@ ers &apos; wages are very high here , whereas coffee harv@@ esting is paid 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million ru@@ pe@@ es ( 16@@ 7 euros ) &quot; explains the por@@ ter , who previously worked as a mas@@ on in the island resort of Bali .
There , his wage was 7@@ 5@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 6.@@ 2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , , , but An@@ to has returned with family to Ban@@ y@@ u@@ wan@@ gi , a village near the volcan@@ o for a comp@@ elling reason which , in Indonesia , is as over@@ riding as the sul@@ ph@@ ur : &quot; I married a girl from Bali , , , , where they are Hin@@ du , and I &apos;ve brought her to Java to convert to Islam &quot;
An@@ to has as@@ th@@ ma , he has difficulty brea@@ thing , cou@@ gh@@ s constantly and his eyes are ir@@ rit@@ ated by the toxic gases .
At 27 years old , An@@ to has been ris@@ king his life for three years in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o , and the sul@@ ph@@ ur has already begun to take its toll on him even though he covers his face with with special m@@ ask and go@@ gg@@ les .
He has as@@ th@@ ma , he has difficulty brea@@ thing , cou@@ gh@@ s constantly and his eyes are ir@@ rit@@ ated by the toxic gases from the volcan@@ o .
This is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams .
&quot; I &apos;ll go working two more years because I want to open a a shop or study Spanish or French &quot; he vo@@ ws in more than acceptable English .
Pun@@ ished life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , wa@@ iter or hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist , but instead he does the work of a mu@@ le .
Shar@@ ing a fil@@ thy wooden h@@ ut with other por@@ ters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sul@@ ph@@ ur doesn &apos;t stop flo@@ wing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glo@@ ws in the dark .
De@@ fying the sha@@ dows , An@@ to desc@@ ends the cr@@ ater and lights the path with a small tor@@ ch attached to the hel@@ met he bought with his money .
Some 400 por@@ ters carry sul@@ ph@@ ur bas@@ k@@ ets on their shoul@@ ders from the cr@@ ater .
Despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechan@@ ised the sul@@ ph@@ ur extrac@@ tion process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the this por@@ ters , , , who work for themselves and by the k@@ il@@ o .
In fact , they do not even see any of the 30@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( as 2.5 euro ) per camera sur@@ charge that , on top of the 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 1.2 euro ) entrance , the gu@@ ards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to phot@@ ograph the volcan@@ o and their human mul@@ es .
&quot; This work is for animals , not people &quot; protests Mad@@ ru@@ sin , a bur@@ ly 4@@ 2@@ -@@ year por@@ ter who has been working at Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en for three decades , since leaving school .
He can lift up to 110 ki@@ los , ensuring that he will go on working &quot; all he can &quot; he needs the money to educ@@ ate his three children , aged between &#91; months ? &#93; and 10 years old .
I won &apos;t reti@@ re , I &apos;ll &apos;ll &apos;ll die here because the volcan@@ o has been my whole life .
Although the sul@@ ph@@ ur bur@@ ns your thro@@ at and st@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and tra@@ ps the min@@ ers in the thick colum@@ ns of smoke coming out of the volcan@@ o , they are so har@@ dy that no@@ -@@ one compla@@ ins of serious ill@@ nesses ... apart , of course , from their common resp@@ ir@@ atory , o@@ ste@@ o@@ ar@@ thri@@ tis , kne@@ e pain and so@@ res on the shoul@@ ders , which have been mis@@ sha@@ pen by the weight of the bas@@ k@@ ets .
Bal@@ an@@ cing the bas@@ ket on his back Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k can only carry 50 ki@@ los now he is years old .
Every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sul@@ ph@@ ur from the volcan@@ o , which three lor@@ ries move to the ware@@ house in Tam@@ ans@@ ari , , , , 18 kilometres away along a go@@ at path that passes through sc@@ rub@@ land .
&quot; I won &apos;t reti@@ re , I &apos;ll die here because the volcan@@ o has been my whole life &quot; a says Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
The oldest his his his five children , 30 years old , also carrying sul@@ ph@@ ur .
Time passes , but poverty perpet@@ u@@ ates from generation to generation in one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world : the one done by human mul@@ es in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en volcan@@ o .
Singapore seeks bab@@ ies to save its economy
Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans blame their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children children children .
Singapore &apos;s population needs to grow . &quot;
I &apos;m a patri@@ o@@ tic husband , you &apos;re my patri@@ o@@ tic wife , let &apos;s do our civi@@ c duty and create life !
It may seem unlikely that these ver@@ ses are part of on an ad@@ ver@@ t for min@@ t swe@@ ets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went vi@@ ral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
The phra@@ ses are part of a ra@@ p and make use of references such as &quot; Let &apos;s put a ba@@ o ( bu@@ n the oven &quot; to make fun of the with birth rate in Singapore .
The company we that made the video , BB@@ H , is hop@@ e@@ ful that the adverti@@ sement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
Its creative director , Dou@@ glas Ham@@ il@@ ton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their &quot; national duty duty . &quot;
It &apos;s purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and am@@ using .
It &apos;s the biggest problem facing this country .
We are world &apos;s worst at re@@ producing our own pro@@ gen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
We knew the Government had tried many things , like launching perf@@ umes with pher@@ om@@ ones or organising speed dating evenings .
Many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn &apos;t necessarily work .
So we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by com@@ posing a ra@@ p ?
1.2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so ligh@@ tly .
It sp@@ ends USD 1,@@ 300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
A government package for marri@@ ages and parents grants up to USD 15@@ ,000 per child , extends mat@@ ernity leave distri@@ butes tax benefits .
But this has all had on little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Sou@@ theast Asia , also known for the con@@ serv@@ atis@@ m of its leaders and its strict social controls .
The birth rate rate rate rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
The last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
So why are Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans not having children ?
T@@ an We@@ i M@@ ing , Director of Mar@@ ri@@ age and Family Policy of the National Pop@@ ulation Division , said that it is a result of &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a wider range of career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; This has given people a wider range of options in of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family &quot; he explains .
These in social nor@@ ms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and dela@@ ying marriage and bir@@ ths , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
Meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline decline has created res@@ ent@@ ment among the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where xen@@ ophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thin@@ ly dis@@ gu@@ ised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
Incre@@ ased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
Since the election has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and le@@ vies for foreign workers .
U@@ ne@@ x@@ pec@@ ted consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation &apos;s economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore &apos;s there are also some un@@ expected consequences .
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses .
For example , it has started to influence the real estate sector .
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments , known as &quot; sho@@ e boxes , &quot; which can be built certain areas of the city .
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
However , there is concern that they may promote we a sing@@ le@@ -@@ living lifestyle and discou@@ rage developers who want to build large family houses .
But , L@@ im Y@@ e@@ w So@@ on , managing director of the real estate company EL Develop@@ ers , says his &quot; sho@@ e boxes &quot; sell much faster than larger units .
They are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , weeks , faster than larger units .
This This means they are much better for our cash flow .
However , he ad@@ mits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
To@@ o stressed
Singapore is a city it State .
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not much impact .
&quot; People are very stressed , houses expensive so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having having a family &quot; says a young executive .
Other people can have children .
&quot; But , for me , it is important to have my own money and time &quot; says another young man of around 20 years old .
Men and women alike mention their care@@ ers , stress and the cost cost cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
So , much as the Government Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to bab@@ ies , the Sing@@ apo@@ re@@ ans have the last word .
What is private off@@ line is private online
Privacy .
According to the Spanish Royal Academy D@@ ic@@ tionary , it means the quality of private life or &quot; the level of privacy which a person entitled be to protect from any interference . &quot;
What is privacy for an under 16 ?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social ?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by air@@ ing information over the Internet which they probably would not share off@@ line ?
El@@ Peri@@ ó@@ dic@@ o inter@@ viewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users .
In four cases , they associated the term with &quot; something much mine &quot; on a personal , and &quot; in the user name and password &quot; when applied to social networks .
&quot; I w@@ ouldn &apos;t upload deep@@ est secre@@ ts in a post &quot; says Jor@@ ge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Hot@@ mail and Windows Live Messenger , with which he he he has had accounts for two years .
&quot; They are very secret secre@@ ts , I &apos;ll tell my mother , but not everybody &quot; he says .
On F@@ B I upload nice nice pictures or games .
And I have fun with people I know . .
&quot; I w@@ ouldn &apos;t share a photo isn &apos;t mine , or that belongs to som@@ ebody who &apos;s doing something stup@@ id &quot; he says .
The child recognises that it is bad to post ob@@ scene pictures of n@@ aked people , crimes , or write humili@@ ating or aggressive comments .
Jor@@ ge says says says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine follo@@ wers on Twitter .
Most are rel@@ atives .
His mother is included , , , , and has the password to one of the accounts .
I opened Twitter to express myself and post t@@ we@@ ets .
&quot; I I I I don &apos;t know if they answer me , I only upload them &quot; he adds .
&quot; Social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to rel@@ atives far away or my friends &quot; he says .
He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
Nor he take any notice of someone recommends a stran@@ ger to him .
The case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different .
This te@@ en@@ ager has accounts with Hot@@ mail , Facebook , My Space and As@@ k , and in last case he ad@@ mits not knowing 20 of the people to friends list .
&quot; It doesn &apos;t b@@ other me , because we have something in common , like music &quot; he says .
The boy says that no@@ -@@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
&quot; If they pres@@ su@@ red me or with asked me for it , I &apos;d just delete them from my account &quot; he states .
Joseph became a follo@@ wer on As@@ k , after reading a recommendation on Twitter .
This te@@ en@@ ager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cy@@ ber@@ bul@@ lying .
An acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ance of a friend of mine was was was being p@@ est@@ ered on a social network .
They were threatening him and demanding money from him .
&quot; I never found out who it was &quot; he says .
The victim , according to José , did not close his account .
&quot; just made it private . &quot;
He then explains a series series series of steps to configure the account safely .
Unlike Jor@@ ge , this boy would upload photos of acqu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces in un@@ comfortable or embar@@ ras@@ sing situations .
I would do it if I didn &apos;t like som@@ ebody , or they made me want to do it .
&quot; However , I know that &apos;s cy@@ ber@@ bul@@ lying &quot; he ad@@ mits .
Key this questions
Mari@@ el@@ os Por@@ ras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and te@@ en@@ agers , they understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
&quot; The Internet emerged as a a a a means of searching for information information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed &quot; he says .
Por@@ ras says the schol@@ ar Marc Pr@@ ens@@ ky , with a Master &apos;s degree in Education from Y@@ ale University and author of the work Digital N@@ atives , Digital Imm@@ igrants , co@@ ined these terms to explain explain explain the phenomenon .
Digital n@@ atives are those children and young people born with to technology .
&quot; We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact &quot; he says .
He says that the issue is complex , &quot; because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to dis@@ close , publish or di@@ vul@@ ge , at an age at which mat@@ urity is not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to this . &quot;
&quot; They also have to selec@@ tive when what most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences &quot; he adds .
According to it the specialist , the effective way to teach children and te@@ en@@ agers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
&quot; T@@ elling them not to do it is no good &quot; he adds .
Por@@ ras then lists some options : are things you w@@ ouldn &apos;t tell a stran@@ ger , so why do it online ?
Or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
Do you know what others publish about you ?
When tag@@ ging party photos , did you ask the other people &apos;s permission to tag them ?
And one more question does everyone need to know what you &apos;re doing all the time ?
point to make them see that they must be@@ have online as they do off@@ line .
The rules are the same .
&quot; Out@@ side the Internet , , , , people act with respect , mor@@ ality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks &quot; he says .
Monitoring
Stu@@ art Gu@@ ard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consul@@ tant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks &apos; policies .
By understanding all the clauses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
&quot; For example , the age at which you are are allowed to share or publish &quot; he says .
According to Gu@@ ar@@ dia , it is important to remind children the &quot; don &apos;t talk to stran@@ gers &quot; lesson .
Un@@ as@@ ur Summit clo@@ ses without making public the Lim@@ a Declaration
The Six@@ th Pre@@ siden@@ tial Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Un@@ as@@ ur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lim@@ a Declaration , previously announced and theore@@ tically signed by the seven atten@@ de@@ e leaders .
E@@ fe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Six@@ th UN@@ AS@@ UR Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Pre@@ siden@@ tial and and and and Chanc@@ ell@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but but but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peru@@ vian Government website .
When asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been dis@@ closed by Peru@@ vian President , Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press .
Journ@@ alists &apos; access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times .
During the summit , in the press room , only video was ai@@ red , with no sound , the presidential meeting with the message &quot; closed session , audio restricted . &quot;
The little information that circul@@ ated among re@@ por@@ ters was given by the press spo@@ kes@@ men of some of the UN@@ AS@@ UR governments attending the the meeting , but not the the the the Peru@@ vian Government . . .
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending pre@@ sidents , which anger@@ ed hundreds of journalists to from various national and international media , who asked for more details .
The Peru@@ vian President then sent an email to the media with the &quot; final statement &quot; of the summit , but this was Hum@@ ala &apos;s statement , and not the the the the official document that closed the summit . . .
Last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South Americ@@ an@@ -@@ Arab Coun@@ tries ( AS@@ PA ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lim@@ a Declaration was again not made public .
The AS@@ PA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday .
At both both both both international events , the Peru@@ vian authorities were at pa@@ ins to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of to a maximum .
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to adju@@ dic@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries .
The Presidents of Peru Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala , and Chile , Sebas@@ ti@@ án Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The Hague , will start to hear the the the arguments arguments arguments arguments of both parties , in the law@@ suit Lim@@ a has filed against Santiago .
&quot; We will o@@ bey execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court said Hum@@ ala , together with his Chi@@ lean counter@@ part .
&quot; Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , gre@@ eting Hum@@ ala with a hand@@ sha@@ ke , alongside the fla@@ gs of the two countries .
Con@@ fir@@ mation of both pre@@ sidents that they would submit to this the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week den@@ ounced the Bo@@ g@@ ot@@ á Pact , whereby it accepted to submit to the jud@@ gement of this international court , following decision on its maritime bound@@ ary with Nic@@ ar@@ agua it regarded as seriously fla@@ wed .
The summit held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , D@@ il@@ ma R@@ ous@@ se@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez ; Boli@@ via , E@@ vo Mor@@ ales ; and Argentina , Crist@@ ina Kir@@ chner .
Parag@@ u@@ ay , which was suspended by UN@@ AS@@ UR in 2011 after the dis@@ miss@@ al of former President Fern@@ ando Lu@@ go , was not involved in the meeting .
Ho@@ st President Ol@@ lan@@ ta Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lim@@ a .
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects projects between the South American countries , for a a a a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
Among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that UN@@ AS@@ UR countries will take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . &quot;
reported that actions are being implemented to improve &quot; cooperation in the fight against in@@ security and transnational organised crime , actions to make make make make medic@@ ation more accessible , low@@ -@@ cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with of natural disasters . &quot;
With With With With Europe in crisis , &quot; economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a trium@@ p@@ ha@@ list attitude but serve to expand are its productive mat@@ rix and gli@@ mp@@ se a better future for its people &quot; Hum@@ ala added .
&quot; We decided to focus on a group of 31 flag@@ ship projects that will improve connection among areas of South , especially in rural and border areas ... un@@ iting our countries and creating new economic networks &quot; said to the Peru@@ vian President in a message read out .
Among these projects , he that five are in Peru and are located in the . trans@@ verse a@@ xes of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecu@@ ador , although he gave no details .
Also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Parag@@ u@@ ay .
&quot; We hope the electoral process in that country serves to re@@ incorporate it in the Union of South American Nations , &quot; from which it is currently excluded .
The need for Latin America to remain a prosp@@ erous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbour@@ ly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
In this sense , the President of Colombia , Manuel San@@ tos , said before attending the start of the regional event that that he expected to meet with his counter@@ part from Nic@@ ar@@ agua , Daniel Or@@ te@@ ga , on Saturday in Mexico , to respec@@ t@@ fully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , ques@@ tioned by Bo@@ g@@ ota .
&quot; The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Or@@ te@@ ga &quot; San@@ tos said .
&quot; We will review all these paths , &#91; which &#93; are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nic@@ ar@@ agua will require a conversation with Nic@@ ar@@ agua &quot; he emphasised .
&quot; With President Or@@ te@@ ga , I hope I can say that that that we handle this in the most civili@@ sed and respec@@ tful manner possible &quot; said San@@ tos .
San@@ tos and Or@@ te@@ ga are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inau@@ gu@@ ration of the country &apos;s new President , En@@ ri@@ que Pe@@ ña N@@ ie@@ to .
Also , as part of the summit , the blo@@ c &apos;s foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina Argentina Argentina Argentina , Boli@@ via , Colombia , Ecu@@ ador , Peru Brazil , Uru@@ gu@@ ay , Venezuela , Chile , Gu@@ y@@ ana , Sur@@ in@@ am and Parag@@ u@@ ay make up UN@@ AS@@ UR , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro tempor@@ e presidency of the regional blo@@ c .
&quot; South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship &quot; says Raf@@ ael Cor@@ rea
The President of Ecu@@ ador , Raf@@ ael Cor@@ rea , said today that the creation of a common citizenship a goal that &quot; South South America in this case , must learn from Europe . &quot;
Cor@@ rea , who took part in the Elev@@ enth Pre@@ siden@@ tial Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) held in Lim@@ a told Peru &apos;s state television that Europeans &quot; killed one in the Second World War &quot; is and other conflicts conflicts , &quot; but are now practically one country . &quot;
To this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship by member countries of UN@@ AS@@ UR .
&quot; We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the An@@ de@@ an Community . However , there are still re@@ ac@@ tionary sectors that want us to return to the past he said .
The Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( O@@ AS ) under the pre@@ m@@ ise of reducing the influence of the An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sax@@ on states and taking into those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights .
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything , we South Americans sign everything .
&quot; It is in@@ comprehensible that the Inter@@ -@@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding &quot; he said referring to Ecu@@ ador giving political asylum to Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder Ju@@ lian Ass@@ ange .
Cor@@ rea said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betra@@ yed his principles , but has respected his &quot; deep democratic and human rights values . &quot;
He added that , at the time , &quot; he had reasonable suspi@@ cion that Ass@@ ange would be ex@@ tradi@@ ted to another country and that his case would not be respected . &quot;
Additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to ques@@ tioning for an alleged sexual off@@ ence his country , , when &quot; Swedish legislation itself dict@@ ates that he can be ques@@ tioned via vide@@ o@@ conference which could be done from the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian E@@ mb@@ assy in London . &quot;
Cor@@ rea said that there is a risk of deterioration of Ass@@ ange &apos;s physical and mental health .
&quot; I have spoken to him since he was at our emb@@ assy , but the amb@@ assador informed me that he he had a minor lung problem , , , nothing serious &quot; said the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President .
What there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deterior@@ ate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; That would complic@@ ate the health of any person &quot; he added .
Cor@@ rea said that the solution to the asylum granted to Ass@@ ange in June by the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian E@@ mb@@ assy , in London , through the issue of a saf@@ e@@ -@@ conduct pass that permits travel to Ecu@@ ador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been been been been talks with London to seek a solution to the im@@ prison@@ ment of the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder .
We do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case but there have been ongoing discussions .
&quot; The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Ass@@ ange &apos;s lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ zon , is handling a series of cases in different European courts &quot; he said .
And he felt that if Britain says no to the saf@@ e@@ -@@ conduct pass , it &apos;s over . &quot; &quot; &quot;
And if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr Ass@@ ange at the E@@ mb@@ assy of Ecu@@ ador in London , or inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ates him via Skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
Cor@@ rea took the opportunity to reas@@ sert himself as a def@@ ender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not toler@@ ate is &quot; the medi@@ o@@ cri@@ ty , dish@@ on@@ est@@ y and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . &quot;
&quot; The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wick@@ ed politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , black@@ mail and ex@@ tor@@ tion &quot; he said .
In that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , &quot; or the ban@@ kers or bour@@ geo@@ is he@@ gemon@@ ic countries that . domin@@ ate Ecu@@ ador &quot; and said that , if re@@ -@@ elected , he will &quot; step up the revolution revolution revolution revolution to continue on same path and in the right direction .
Cor@@ rea also supported the decision to maintain the ve@@ to on Parag@@ u@@ ay in UN@@ AS@@ UR , at least until their next elections , argu@@ ing that the body &quot; must be firm and not toler@@ ate opport@@ un@@ ism and a coup mas@@ ked leg@@ ality &quot; because this will in fact &quot; destroy the legitimacy of Parag@@ u@@ ay@@ an democracy . &quot;
The Ecu@@ ad@@ orian President President President also considered the the &quot; perfectly per@@ tin@@ ent &quot; desire his Colom@@ bian counter@@ part , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , to now negotiate with Nic@@ ar@@ agua the maritime bound@@ ary between the two countries countries countries countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , in favour Nic@@ ar@@ ag@@ uan maritime sovereignty .
For now that ruling is not being followed .
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t is inevitable , must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them them them and move forward .
Additionally , he tru@@ sted in a sound conclusion to the maritime bound@@ ary dispute op@@ posing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that &quot; it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard be it may be . &quot;
With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecu@@ ador seeking a third consec@@ utive term , he said he possibility &quot; with much optim@@ ism joy although at times it is pretty hard . &quot;
Cor@@ rea said that if he loses the elections in February 2013 , he will reti@@ re from public life .
Person@@ ally , I &apos;ve never been interested in power , but in situations as un@@ just as those in Ecu@@ ador , soci@@ o@@ -@@ economic poverty can only be by political power .
&quot; My political movement believed that was me who ensured that prob@@ able victory , so we have to accept that responsibility &quot; he said .
If I won , it would be last period in office and then then then then I would leave public life . for
If I lose , likewise .
&quot; It &apos;s a decision &quot; he confirmed .
Cor@@ rea also referred to Venezu@@ el@@ an President Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez &apos;s new health treatment in Cuba .
I just spoke Venezu@@ el@@ an Vice President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro and he tells me that Cha@@ vez went for treatment that was was was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
&quot; This does not mean a health rela@@ pse for President Cha@@ vez &quot; said .
In Lim@@ a today , the Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Head of of of State attended the Six@@ th Summit of of of of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( ( UN@@ AS@@ UR ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
De@@ a@@ ths caused be by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection
Fabri@@ zio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive .
&quot; It was like a bom@@ b dropped on me &quot; he says , rec@@ alling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make &quot; so@@ fter , &quot; apparently un@@ successfully .
The boy hi@@ d it from his family .
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 4@@ 3rd birthday .
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Gu@@ adal@@ aj@@ ara Civil Hospital ( CH@@ G ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several batt@@ les with his health .
Fabri@@ zio has lived with the human imm@@ un@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of sti@@ g@@ ma .
Then , even the director director director director of an IM@@ SS &#91; Mex@@ ican Social Security Institute &#93; clin@@ ic refused to discharge him &quot; because he had a cut . &quot;
At that time , having A@@ ids was syn@@ onymous with death .
Now it is possible survive the syn@@ dro@@ me and do so with quality of life .
However , many people are un@@ aware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already with caused ha@@ vo@@ c , &quot; exhau@@ sted &quot; their imm@@ une and they are suffering from opport@@ un@@ istic infec@@ tions . . .
31 years after of the on@@ set of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , &quot; the great achievement at this time we is that the life expec@@ tan@@ cy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expec@@ tan@@ cy of the general population is exactly equal &quot; stated the of the CH@@ G HIV Unit , J@@ aim@@ e An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva , saying that this information be was endorsed in this year in a prestigious scientific journ@@ al .
Inf@@ ec@@ tious disease specialist and expert in HIV / AIDS , An@@ dra@@ de Vil@@ lan@@ u@@ eva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was was was not a sentence , but that life expec@@ tan@@ cy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the imm@@ une system that patients present when they are diagno@@ sed , of a higher life expec@@ tan@@ cy for non@@ -@@ drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those those those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count .
In simple terms , this means that anyone diagno@@ sed HIV positive at 25 years , under these terms and &quot; as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 &quot; said the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e . .
To gau@@ ge this progress , it should be remember@@ ed that the average expec@@ tan@@ cy of Mex@@ ic@@ ans today is 76 years .
Although mor@@ tali@@ ty has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from and 6,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4,@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 ( UN@@ AIDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the adv@@ ent of AIDS , 60 per of patients in the national database have died .
In J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o alone , only 25@@ 5 people died in 2011 , and there have been 18@@ 7 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs since 2005 .
- it Why are do still deaths occur ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
That &apos;s how I view it , and that &apos;s how it &apos;s been at our hospital .
For at least the last 12 years we had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive an advanced state of illness because they are un@@ aware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
He gave a comp@@ elling stati@@ stic : &quot; N@@ ine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opport@@ un@@ istic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mor@@ tali@@ ty is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and , therefore , offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . &quot;
Speci@@ alists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Pre@@ vention in J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o ( CO@@ ES@@ ID@@ A ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fabri@@ zio , who came to be tested at a private laboratory laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and even suffered K@@ apos@@ i sar@@ com@@ a , a can@@ cer@@ ous tum@@ our that that is one of the common complic@@ ations .
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
Some people people people think they &apos;re going to die and don &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; If I &apos;m going to die , I &apos;d rather have a blo@@ w@@ -@@ out three times a week &quot; they , but not in case .
The was for the better ; I well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
To date , his parents are only aware he had cancer .
I live as normal a life as anyone else .
&quot; I work , I take part in a lot lot lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person &quot; said Fabri@@ zio , who agreed to share his intimate secre@@ ts with M@@ IL@@ EN@@ IO J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motiv@@ ate those people with with with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
They should should should should get tested if they are at ris@@ k@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagno@@ sed , they that must learn live live live like any other person , while being responsible .
This is his message , which sum@@ mar@@ ises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
Con@@ d@@ oms behind the counter .
The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ric@@ ardo Sal@@ az@@ ar , a journalist from Gu@@ adal@@ aj@@ ara has taken up the HIV cause .
And the greatest cure is prevention .
In places dedicated to this task &quot; the distribution of con@@ d@@ oms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us pack@@ ets of as a hundred , and that &apos;s fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access con@@ d@@ oms &quot; he said .
Among the most vulnerable to new infec@@ tions are te@@ en@@ agers .
&quot; Why do you want them ? &quot; is a common question , asked with sar@@ cas@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers , coun@@ s@@ ell@@ ors , pharm@@ acy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to ex@@ pose te@@ en@@ agers to sex , said the speaker .
It was decided to change such in@@ efficient allocation , and that con@@ d@@ oms should not only placed behind coun@@ ters , but that pack@@ ets of one hundred should be found in public toilet disp@@ en@@ sers in places frequ@@ ented young people .
This are is not promoting promis@@ cu@@ ity .
It is not about paying for their be@@ ers or m@@ otel fees , as Govern@@ or Em@@ ili@@ o Gonz@@ al@@ ez said , when asked if there would be distribution of con@@ d@@ oms during his administration .
&quot; And it &apos;s not about sexu@@ ality , but it is best to provide con@@ d@@ oms to those already practi@@ sing sexual activity he said .
J@@ ali@@ sc@@ o key , points
There There There There are 13@@ ,@@ 4@@ 35 cum@@ ulative cases ( 12@@ ,@@ 15@@ 8 AIDS and 1,@@ 3@@ 17 HIV ) .
The state is 4th in the nation in new and cum@@ ulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV .
92 % of new infec@@ tions are through sex , 6 % via the bloo@@ d@@ stream and The 2 % per@@ in@@ at@@ al .
An estimated 50@@ ,000 people may be living HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4@@ -@@ 5 people who do not know they are positive .
Rati@@ fied by a United States court of appeal , a jud@@ gement which igno@@ res the restructuring of the Vit@@ ro Group &apos;s debt achieved via a bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy in Mexico , the scenario is an om@@ in@@ ous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solven@@ cy problems .
It seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mex@@ ican law are not valid in the land of stars and stri@@ pes , contrary to international conventions .
In practical terms , the endor@@ sement of the jud@@ gement delivered on 15 June by Ju@@ dge Har@@ lin H@@ ale of the Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Court of the Northern District of Texas , leaves Mex@@ ican firms defen@@ cel@@ ess against possible sei@@ z@@ ure of their property outside of Mexico .
However , the decision opens the door for the leading glass The manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to is Supreme Court of the United States , claim@@ ing three in@@ consisten@@ cies .
From the start , while the trial judge notes that credi@@ tors should be governed by I the United States Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Code , the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the the Fif@@ th Cir@@ cu@@ it , based in New Or@@ le@@ ans , states that the main action is the in@@ solven@@ cy action handled in Mexico .
The first point would involve ignor@@ ing international procedural cooperation in cases of in@@ solven@@ cy of companies with transnational profiles .
Indeed , the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uni@@ formity was for this purpose , with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitr@@ ator .
Secondly , the jud@@ gement establishes that without the inter@@ company vote , with the debts the Vit@@ ro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the in@@ solven@@ cy , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
However , Mex@@ ican law recognises the possibility .
In fact , , the Vit@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted .
There are half a do@@ zen examples , including Agre@@ me@@ x and Commer@@ cial Mex@@ ic@@ ana , whose inter@@ company debts were endorsed by the Federal Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Institute .
What is also certain is that , not the votes of subsidiaries , the Vit@@ ro credi@@ tors who fought it in , the US courts , namely &quot; vul@@ ture &quot; funds such as Au@@ reli@@ os Capital , Au@@ reli@@ os Conver@@ gence , El@@ li@@ ot International and Li@@ ver@@ pool Limited , did not achieve a majority .
The vote was apparently 45 percent ver@@ sus 37 .
This data is is is is om@@ it@@ ted by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al .
From another perspective , the latter bl@@ ames Vit@@ ro for for for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 while trying to avoid severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country .
For now , the Gonz@@ al@@ ez S@@ ada family firm has lo@@ dged a motion for re@@ consideration before the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al for the vote to reach the plenary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .
Should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Supreme Court , will will will will be filed .
The real problem is that the court b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed a document sent by the the Government of Mexico in the the capacity of am@@ ic@@ us curi@@ ae ( &quot; friend of the Court &quot; ) , which details the procedure followed by Vit@@ ro under the framework of the Commer@@ cial In@@ solven@@ cy Law , not@@ ing that the latter latter disch@@ ar@@ ged itself with adher@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chap@@ ter of the Bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy Act of the United States .
Moreover , it should be that the country yiel@@ ded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross@@ -@@ border in@@ solven@@ cy cases , ensuring fair@@ ness for deb@@ tors and credi@@ tors .
Double wh@@ am@@ my : to Vit@@ ro hit and country hit .

H@@ ector &quot; H@@ eti@@ n &quot; Re@@ yes : &quot; Bas@@ ketball has been my life &quot;
Bas@@ ketball glo@@ betro@@ tter H@@ ector &quot; H@@ eti@@ n &quot; Re@@ yes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks it , trav@@ elled the world .
Fe@@ w people in Puerto R@@ ico have a mental rec@@ ol@@ lec@@ tion of local bas@@ ketball history as broad as that of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor &quot; H@@ eti@@ n &quot; Re@@ yes .
Re@@ yes was immer@@ sed in the sport for over 60 years before being con@@ fined to a whe@@ el@@ chair in 2008 following a stro@@ ke ; he was a minor le@@ ague player , National Superior Bas@@ ketball player , B@@ S@@ N representative and manager with the Bay@@ am@@ ón V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os or President of the Bas@@ ketball Federation .
&quot; I wor@@ e lots of h@@ ats in bas@@ ketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the B@@ S@@ N , general manager and feder@@ ative president of the National Team the &apos; 9@@ 0s , , , , &quot; rec@@ alled Re@@ yes during Pri@@ mer@@ a Hor@@ a &apos;s visit to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ón , where he lives with Isa@@ bel , his lo@@ yal wife for over 50 years .
&quot; Bas@@ ketball has been my life . &quot;
Re@@ yes is not exag@@ ger@@ ating when he makes that statement .
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memor@@ abili@@ a den@@ oting his long , which goes to prove it .
Bay@@ am@@ ón at heart
Of them all , the ones he treas@@ ures with the most emo@@ tion the that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os , from the mid@@ -@@ 50@@ s as a player until 1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co@@ -@@ agent or agent of the fran@@ chise .
&quot; Those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os &apos; eight champ@@ ion@@ ships , since 1967 , either as agent , co@@ -@@ agent or manager .
There were many good good years , including the the five consec@@ utive champ@@ ion@@ ships from 1971 to 1975 .
And then I said good@@ by@@ e with one in 1981 , Jer@@ ome M@@ inc@@ y &apos;s de@@ but year in the B@@ S@@ N .
Then &quot; Cu@@ co &quot; Or@@ tiz took over - he was a great manager &quot; said Re@@ yes .
I remember that G@@ ene Bar@@ to@@ w , who had directed here and was at the University of Al@@ ab@@ ama ( Bir@@ m@@ ingham ) , said to me &apos; I &apos;ve got a very strong player for you , 6 &apos; 7 &quot; t@@ all .
Do you him ? &apos;
And that was the beginning of M@@ inc@@ y , one of the best players Puerto R@@ ico ever had .
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the sharp@@ sho@@ oter G@@ aus@@ se Ra@@ y@@ mond , who established re@@ sidency here and was one of our best sho@@ ot@@ ers .
I remember him saying that if M@@ inc@@ y had given Bay@@ am@@ on one champ@@ ionship , G@@ aus@@ se help get another .
The V@@ aqu@@ er@@ os &apos; champ@@ ionship with G@@ aus@@ se enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a feder@@ ative big@@ shot .
For that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and M@@ inc@@ y &apos;s accompli@@ sh@@ ments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the Pre@@ -@@ Olymp@@ ics in Mexico .
Then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bron@@ ze , but for the Canadian refer@@ ee who made us repeat the final play for the second , said Re@@ yes .
Is the 1990 National Team the best you &apos;ve ever seen ?
It &apos;s one of the best , as good the one that beat the Dre@@ am Team in I the 2004 Olymp@@ ics .
However , my favourite was the one in the 1991 P@@ an American Games in Cuba , when we gold and gave the US team a be@@ ating , which was quite similar to the time we won bron@@ ze at the World Cup .
That team not only again included M@@ inc@@ y , G@@ aus@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ vas , F@@ ico L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z and &apos; P@@ icul@@ ín &apos; ( Or@@ tiz ) , also the young ( J@@ avi@@ er ) &apos; To@@ ñ@@ ito &apos; Col@@ ón and James Car@@ ter , the Le@@ on bro@@ thers ( Francisco and Ed@@ gar ) and Mario Qui@@ j@@ ote &apos; Mor@@ ales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a kne@@ e injury .
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a a a a gold med@@ al and was a a a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre@@ -@@ Olympic in Neu@@ qu@@ en , Argentina .
With role players such as &apos; Can@@ ito &apos; N@@ iev@@ es , P@@ ab@@ lo Alic@@ ea and the young Rol@@ ando H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ iner replacing the players suspended after the sh@@ amb@@ les of the Mar del Plat@@ a Pan@@ -@@ American Games , we won gold against all the od@@ ds .
Who was the best Puerto Puerto Puerto Ric@@ an ?
Without any doubt , P@@ icul@@ ín Or@@ tiz .
His numbers at international tournament level are a@@ wes@@ ome .
N@@ obo@@ dy in Puerto R@@ ico has dominated at that level P@@ icul@@ ín did .
Not to mention his career in the various le@@ ag@@ ues he played in . ,
Who the best Puerto Ric@@ an manager ?
That &apos;s a difficult one .
We had a very good team , including Juli@@ o Tor@@ o , with Fl@@ or Mel@@ ende@@ z , Carlos Mor@@ ales , Ra@@ y@@ mond Dal@@ ma@@ u , Ar@@ man@@ di@@ to Tor@@ res . ,
Of the yo@@ ung@@ sters , I really like the work of Le@@ o Ari@@ ll .
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the feder@@ ation ?
Having been part of the National Team &apos;s most gl@@ orious era between 1988 and 1995 in the early 9@@ 0s the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
What was there left for you you you you to do ?
There were things I &apos;d have liked to implement implement , such as region@@ alising the minor le@@ ag@@ ues .
For example , the boys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national play@@ off@@ s .
Right now the kids are riding and playing too much , un@@ necessarily .
At least see the fruit fruit fruit of compulsory certi@@ fications and a course for leaders , table officials and refer@@ ees .
That ple@@ ases me .
What are you doing now ?
The most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube , enjoy my grand@@ children and occasionally go to bas@@ ketball games .
And of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Eli@@ za@@ beth , who has always been with me .

&quot; Lar@@ ry was back in his bel@@ o@@ ved hom@@ et@@ own of D@@ all@@ as , once again representing the i@@ con@@ ic role he most liked &quot; the family said .
Lar@@ ry &apos;s family and closest friends were with him in D@@ all@@ as for the Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving Day holiday .
Lin@@ da Gra@@ y , who played his wife in the original series and the sequ@@ el , was with H@@ ag@@ man when he died in a hospital in D@@ all@@ as , said her public@@ ist , J@@ eff@@ rey Lan@@ e .
He brought joy to all who knew him .
He was creative , generous , fun@@ ny , lo@@ ving and and and tal@@ ented , and I will miss him de@@ arly .
&quot; was an original guy and lived life to the full &quot; said Gra@@ y in a statement .
H@@ ag@@ man was diagno@@ sed with cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver in 1992 and admitted that he had dr@@ unk lot over the the the years .
In 1995 a ma@@ lig@@ n@@ ant tum@@ our as found in his li@@ ver and he under@@ went a transp@@ l@@ ant .
Y@@ ears before &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ all@@ as , &quot; H@@ ag@@ man became famous on television as a decent guy in the light com@@ edy &quot; I Dre@@ am of Je@@ ann@@ ie , &quot; ai@@ red on N@@ BC from 1965 to 1970 .
He played Captain Tony N@@ elson , an a@@ stron@@ aut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive gen@@ ie , played by Bar@@ bara Eden , and takes her home to live with him .

His film work included roles well received by critics in &quot; The Group , &quot; &quot; Harry and T@@ onto &quot; and &quot; Pri@@ mary Col@@ ors . &quot;

drama series on C@@ BS about the E@@ wing cl@@ an and other characters in their or@@ bit ai@@ red from April 1978 to May 1991 .
The tag@@ line &quot; Who shot J@@ R ? , &quot; designed to generate h@@ ype around an episode full of emotions in which H@@ ag@@ man &apos;s character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of ris@@ ky dollars wag@@ ered in gaming establishments .
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million be vie@@ wers tun@@ ed in and made &quot; D@@ all@@ as &quot; the second most wat@@ ched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of &quot; MAS@@ H &quot; in 1983 , which had 50 million vie@@ wers .
It was J@@ R &apos;s si@@ ster@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ law Kris@@ tin ( played by Mary Cro@@ s@@ by ) who shot him .
J@@ R got her pregn@@ ant then threatened to say she was a pro@@ stitute unless she she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him .
H@@ ag@@ man portra@@ yed E@@ wing as a cor@@ rupt ins@@ ati@@ able man with a char@@ ism@@ atic s@@ mile : a dish@@ on@@ est entrepren@@ eur and che@@ ating husband who tried to have his his his his alcoholi@@ c wife , Su@@ e El@@ len ( Lin@@ da Gra@@ y ) , sec@@ tioned . .
&quot; I know what I want on J@@ R &apos;s tom@@ b@@ stone &quot; H@@ ag@@ man said in 1988 .
It should read : &quot; Here lies the honest citizen J@@ R E@@ wing . &quot;
This is the only deal he lost .

Start a course that explo@@ res the &quot; End of the World &quot;
Each week week , students explore apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , , , , z@@ om@@ bies , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
This term , when Professor of religion , Stu@@ art Char@@ m@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a comp@@ elling ho@@ ok : The end of the &quot; long coun@@ t@@ down &quot; of the May@@ an calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming .
But Char@@ m@@ é had no idea what awa@@ ited him over the next couple of months : The cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ sm@@ ic hur@@ ri@@ cane Sand@@ y , a a fiscal pre@@ cip@@ ice some called &quot; debt Ar@@ ma@@ ge@@ d@@ don &quot; and a growing conflict involving , where end@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ world Christians the@@ ori@@ sts think the Apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se will begin .
&quot; I didn &apos;t realise this was going to be the most most most most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic term ever &quot; said Char@@ m@@ é this week to students at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s@@ -@@ Cam@@ den University ( New Jer@@ sey ) .
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
And remember that bad is good good for those with an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic ment@@ ality .
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the and &quot; end of the world &quot; this term , theore@@ tically the last in history .
At Temple , Associ@@ ate Professor Bar@@ ry V@@ ack@@ er is giving the course &quot; Media , Culture and the end of the world . &quot;
Each week , students explore apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic themes such as nuclear war , The z@@ om@@ bies , viruses viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
&quot; We looked at why these ideas pro@@ lifer@@ ate over time &quot; he said , and how they offer hypo@@ the@@ tical scen@@ arios that guide human behaviour .
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
month students analy@@ sed movies with an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic theme and explo@@ red how they compare with real@@ -@@ life examples
&quot; I &apos;ve tried tried tried to inform students about what is possible , prob@@ able , credible and impossible &quot; said V@@ ack@@ er .
At the main P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania State University camp@@ us , Latin American History Professor Mat@@ the@@ w Re@@ st@@ all , and his colleague Am@@ ara Sol@@ ari , an Associ@@ ate Art History and An@@ thropo@@ logy Professor , have te@@ amed up to give a course , called simply &quot; The end of the world . &quot;
&quot; We don &apos;t add &apos; 2012 &apos; so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn &apos;t come to an end &quot; &quot; said Re@@ st@@ all .
Despite the &quot; im@@ pending do@@ om , &quot; students have to study , undertake projects take final exam@@ s .
At P@@ enn State , the final ex@@ am will be taken on the eve of the Apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se , which leaves no choice but to work &quot; until the very night the world is supposed to end &quot; said Re@@ st@@ all
The courses proved quite popular .
&quot; It was fully booked within two hours &quot; said Re@@ st@@ all , on his course for students with high aver@@ ages , which was filled with 35 students .
We received em@@ ails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , people asking if there were any places .
Stu@@ dents , mean@@ while , say the course is one of the most interesting around .
&quot; I find it fascinating to see what people do to con@@ sole themselves &quot; said Bri@@ d@@ gi@@ d Rob@@ inson , a 23@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old post@@ -@@ gradu@@ ate Religion and Soci@@ ology student from H@@ add@@ on@@ field , New Jer@@ sey , at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s@@ -@@ Cam@@ den .
And apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic , secular or religious ment@@ ality is just a matter con@@ sol@@ ation or a lack of it .
Will W@@ ek@@ esa , a 25@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old post@@ -@@ gradu@@ ate Psych@@ ology and N@@ ur@@ sing student , said he had seen all the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic movies . . .
&quot; I &apos;d never heard of a class that could teach it &quot; he said
I enjoy it .
But none of the students inter@@ viewed - much less any professor - said believed in the end date of December 21st .
&quot; Our first project project project project was about May@@ an proph@@ ec@@ y and to a certain extent we dis@@ credited it &quot; said Ju@@ lie Z@@ eg@@ len , a 2@@ 1@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old final year student at Temple , from West Ch@@ ester .
The May@@ ans never predic@@ ted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Re@@ st@@ all .
But he said that culture suff@@ ers from apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic anxi@@ ety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react react react to changes around by predic@@ ting the end of the world .
The Internet has caused a boom in these spec@@ ul@@ ations .
&quot; In other , people don don don don &apos;t think about it &quot; he said .
It &apos;s mostly in the Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ speaking world .
Joseph Dou@@ gh@@ er@@ ty , a Professor of religion at La S@@ alle University . , who is giving courses in the Philipp@@ ines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the &quot; end of the world &quot; there .
&quot; The Philipp@@ ines are not taking part the end of the world &quot; he for wrote , sugge@@ sting an exception of a higher authority .
We have an indul@@ gence from the P@@ ope .
Re@@ st@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last jud@@ gement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , &quot; people will immediately start thinking of the next date &quot; or philosoph@@ ising that December 21st is the beginning of a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year period after which the world will end .
Stu@@ dents and teachers are taking the date ligh@@ tly .
Some said they plan to go to &quot; end of the world &quot; parties .
&quot; Maybe I &apos;ll call some friends so we can have a lau@@ gh together &quot; said Sam@@ ira Ford , 20@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old communications student .
